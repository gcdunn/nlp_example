No interpreter is using such crappy technique nowadays. Taw\\n\\n=== From Interpreted Language/Talk ===\\n \\n:some languages (like Perl) are compiled at runtime\\n\\nCould you elaborate ? Taw\\n\\nEvery time a perl script is run, Perl compiles it and then runs the compiled code. At least, this is the usual way of using perl, although it\\'s not the only way. Zundark, 2001 Dec 15\\n\\nYou mean compile to syntactic tree or compile to machine code ? Taw\\n\\n: I believe it\\'s compiled to bytecode, much like Java. As of perl 5.6 (version?), it\\'s possible to produce a bytecode version of a perl program to save the compilation step. I think the bytecode can be converted back to full source as well, but I\\'m not as sure about that. Indigo Perl (http://www.indigoperl.com) produces a perl compiler that produces a machine executable, but I think the resulting executable consists of both the actual bytecode and enough of the perl engine to run the bytecode, so they tend to be rather large. Their advantage is being able to deploy the code to machines that don\\'t necessarily have the Perl interpreter installed.  They have versions for both Windows and Unix-ish platforms.  Wesley\\n\\n=== Old Interpreted Language article ===\\n\\nAn interpreted language is a type of programming language that is not compiled into machine code, but is interpreted at run-time by the computer, and translated into machine understandable code as required.\\n\\nIt is often a mistake to refer to a language as either \"\"interpreted\"\" or \"\"compiled\"\", because\\nmost languages can be implemented in either way, and some languages\\n(like Perl) are compiled at\\nruntime but behave as if they were interpreted.\\nOther languages, like Java, may be partially compiled into an\\nintermediate form which is then interpreted (although that, too, might be compiled).\\nSome languages, though, are specifically designed to favor interpretation.\\n\\nAn example of an interpreted language is JavaScript.\\n\\n\\nIs Java interpreted, or what? \\n\\nThe Java programming language article says:\\n\\n:\"\"The first implementations of the language used an interpreted virtual machine to achieve portability, and many implementations still do. These implementations produce programs that run more slowly than the fully-compiled programs created by the typical C++ compiler and some later Java language compilers, so the language suffered a reputation for producing slow programs. More recent implementations of the Java VM produce programs that run much faster, using multiple techniques.\"\"\\n\\n\\nThe Java language is compiled, always.  It is designed as a compiled language, and is implemented as a compiled language.  It is often compiled into bytecode, which is then interpreted (with a virtual machine).  I think the Java language article is correct, but maybe it could be worded better.  LDC\\n\\nYes, and you can also compile Jave straight down to machine code if you like. The above claim that it is a mistake to differentiate between interpreted and compiled languages is IMHO incorrect; every language that has an \"\"eval\"\" statement which lets you construct and evaluate statements on the fly can never be cleanly compiled down to machine code; you will always have to embed an interpreter in your compiled code. AxelBoldt\\n\\nWay too much mess here has been caused by lack of clear definition of \"\"compiling\"\".\\nIt is used in two distinct meanings, as in:\\n# compiled to machine code (or assembly)\\n# compiled to byte code/parse tree/some other internal representation\\n\\nI think it\\'s wrong to call languages that use the second way \"\"compiled\"\". In such case there would be virtually no interpreted language in use - no language uses line-by-line parsing nowadays, all \"\"compile\"\" source to some form of internal representation.\\n\\nQuote from FOLDOC:\\n     Compiler\\n\\n     A program that converts another program\\n     from some {source language} (or {programming language}) to\\n     {machine language} (object code).

       "       '\"\\n\\n==66.185.85.80\\'s rant==\\n\\nPresently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as \"\"primitive\"\" and \"\"rural\"\" (even \"\"fashist\"\") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, \"\"performed\"\" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.\\n \\nAnother \"\"apostle\"\" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as \"\"gusle players\"\". \\n\\nSome even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović\\'s book \"\"Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje\"\", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry. \\n \\nNot far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić\\'s work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.  \\n\\nIn addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn\\'t play gusle (it\\'s    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound. \\n\\nOlinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar. \\n\\nThe Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  \"\"Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West\"\" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)\\n\\nThis admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)\\n\\nNow, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region. \\n\\nHaving this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock \\'n\\' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre',\n",

       "       '\"\\n::\"\"Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/botanists by nationality lists a 4-4 vote, which is hardly a consensus to make the changes you did. Some of the categories you emptied have been around for six months at least, such as British botanists, so it wasn\\'t just an anon (who was most likely  logged out, as the software is wont to do). Although I understand that you personally think nationality is unimportant, that is just your POV; for a high-school teacher in New Zealand or Brazil looking up homegrown botanists for the class to write about, that is quite relevant, and nearly impossible to find out without the subcategories. In any case, you\\'re setting yourself against the hundreds of editors who have built Category:Nationalities by occupation and Category:People by nationality and their thousands of subcategories. Either botanists are fundamentally different from other kinds of people (which could be argued I suppose -) ), or all these other editors are mistaken, in which case you should convince them of their wrongness first before unilaterally emptying out the category. But given that Category:American actors alone has some 3,000 names, I don\\'t think you\\'re going to get much of a favorable hearing! If you want to argue that the botanists is still too small to be subdivided, that\\'s plausible, but your argument seems to be that the category shouldn\\'t be subdivided no matter how large it gets. Just as you expect other people to defer to your knowledge in matters arboreal, you should respect those who are more knowledgeable about information organization.  \"\"\\n:::Hi Stan - several points; first, neither was there any consensus for Pcpcpc\\'s (if they were his) changes in the first place; I was restoring the original status quo, not making a change. And no request for comment had been made at either WP:TOL talk or from regular botanical contributors, as should have been done, before making that change. Second, botanists are fundamentally different from (almost) all other kinds of people when it comes to nationality; e.g. uniquely only botanists and ornithologists working in Britain and Germany among all people maintained friendly communication and exchange of scientific information throughout the second world war. Third, yes, botanists are too small to subdivide; all but 4 or 5 of the new subcategories created had less than five entries, which is pretty ridiculous; it is not comparable to actors at all. Fourth, and most important of all, is the need to have all the botanists at a single source for reference. There are thousands of plant articles that are being written or having their taxoboxes updated; both involve adding the line {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = | author = }} ; one takes a species, and looks up the botanical name and author citation to enter there, e.g. {{Taxobox_section_binomial_botany | color = lightgreen| binomial_name = Pinus ayacahuite| author = Ehrenb. ex Schltdl.}}; this gives you two authors to link in, with no information on their nationality. One can then get their full names from the [http://www.ipni.org/ipni/query_author.html IPNI author query page], but that still leaves the article writer with the task of finding the botanist\\'s wiki page - does the botanist Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal have a page at all? Is it at [[Diederich Franz Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Franz von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich Leonhard von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. L. von Schlechtendal]], or [[Diederich F. von Schlechtendal]]? The simple way to do this is to look up in [[:Category:botanists]]. If you have to search through 30-odd subcategories and sub-subcategories - it takes an hour to do something that should take 2 minutes. So you don\\'t, you give up in disgust. Or else start a new duplicate page about the botanist. It is quite clear from both 82.35.37.118\\'s and Pcpcpc\\'s contributions lists, that they\\'ve not had any experience at all of writing plant articles, and I think they should listen to those who do. - ~~~~\\n\\n\"',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n== One MO\\' time for the kids in the back... ==\\n\\nJUST can’t let go of a few items, huh?\\n\\nOkay from the top:\\n1) My info on the GLAAD awards and the EISNER Nominations came from Winick’s website. BUT is that’s not good enough…\\n\\n2)  I did a quick GOOGLE ( WINICK and GLAAD AWARDS) and found various articles to that effect. Here’s one that mention awards from 2001 & 2002\\n\\nhttp://www.psicofxp.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-105929.html\\n\\nhere’s the link to the GLAAD awards in 2003 ( they don’t archive back further then that)\\n\\nhttp://www.glaad.org/media/release_detail.php?id=3393&PHPSESSID;=84e84fd40ccf1d3ee7499d7ff630ca43\\n \\nand a photo from 2003\\n\\nhttp://www.glaad.org/publications/resource_doc_detail.php?id=3396&PHPSESSID;=84e84fd40ccf1d3ee7499d7ff630ca43\\n\\n3) the Eisners was more difficult because were too many sites and not a definitive archive. I punched in \"\"Winick and Eisner awards\"\" into GOOGLE and got over 500 hits. Some mention his nominations in articles ABOUT him, some site specific years in articles ABOUT the Eisner nominations. It doesn’t look like his website is lying…\\n\\nNow, onto some specific comments:\\n\\n\"\"Furthermore, I saw the article more pro-gay than anti-gay. I think the previous version of the article attempts to put Judd in a rather \"\"heroic\"\" role by saying that he pushed boundaries and was willing to shrug off industry standards to get his point across. It may have had a POV issue, but I don\\'t think that it was homophobic. I would be careful about throwing that word around, being that you are suggesting unbiased claims. Practice what you preach, and all that.\"\"\\n\\nForgive me jumping the gun on mentioning \"\"homophobia\"\", but the article REALLY didn’t read as positive or heroic when: \\n1) It focussed  –almost ENTIRELY—on the issue of Winick writing about gays.\\n \\n2)Tossed some interpretation that he made Robin( of Batman and Robin) into a crossdresser ( which he didn’t. it was JOKE. It’d be like accusing MONTY PYTHON of promoting \"\" lifestyle choices\"\" by having them dress as women all the time)\\n\\n3)Adding/allowing an erroneous comment from another comic book creator. (MIKE Miller, later changed into the a false statement by FRANK Miller)\\n\\n4) And lastly, make mention of \"\" gay groups\"\" who took issue with, disagreed with, etc, Mr. Winick’s portrayal of gays. No evidence t that fact was given and it appears that the VAST majority of the gay community doesn’t have a problem with him.\\n\\nAll of THIS, didn’t really come off as an endorsement, a slap on the back, or in much of ANY way that he was being applauded for making a stand.\\n\\n\\n\"\"I would add two points: (1) The article should definitely include some discussion, albeit NPOV, of Winick\\'s penchant for gay characters. He has consistently used his writing to present gay characters and homosexual issues to young readers. He hasn\\'t made a secret of that, either. The article should be neutral, but that fact is a critical facet of Winick\\'s career. \"\"\\n\\nI don’t agree. It COVERS the issue already. You’re asking for an opinion. I’ve been told, several times, that THAT isn’t the point of this site.\\n\\nAlso, \"\"Winick\\'s penchant for gay characters\"\". Why JUST talk about gays? I mean, is it because  he get PRESS about them?  He’s got LOTS of other people in his comics. But if you’re mentioning GAYS because it’s gotten media coverage, then THAT is already IN the article. No need to expand on it.\\n\\n\"\"He has consistently used his writing to present gay characters and homosexual issues to young readers. He hasn\\'t made a secret of that, either.\"\"\\n\\n1) What’s all this stuff about YOUNG readers? Comics, and even his book were aimed at ALL readers? Are you trying to slide in a sideways comment that Winick is targeting children? And secondly, in the 3 times I’ve heard Winick talk about this subject he always comes back to the point that he includes ALL types of people in his stories. Diversity is the goal.\\n\\nIn general you seem VERY intent on shining a different light on this issue. One that falls into opinion and editorializing.\\n The facts are covered. It’s there. It’s done.\\n\\n\\n(2) He is not considered \"\"one of the top writers\"\" in comics. Frank Miller, Grant Morrison, Jeph Loeb...there are plenty of names at the top, but Winick\\'s has never been among them. I\\'ve never read a claim otherwise, either  so if this article is going to allege Winick\\'s prominence, you\\'d better include some sort of citation. \\n\\nWell, 1) It doesn’t say he’s the MOST prominent writer in comics like a Frank  Miller, Neil Gaiman,  Grant Morrison or an Alan Moore. It’s says ONE of the top writers.\\nTo that fact, He’s one of only about 30 writers signed exclusively, he writes top titl',\n",
       "       'International Symposium on Dr Axel Munthe\\n\\n\\nThe second  international symposium on Dr Axel Munthe’s  life and work   will be held  on Saturday 13th of September at Hildasholm, Leksand, Sweden. \\n\\nFrom the Royal College of Physicians in London, Professor Ian McDonald (adjunct Prof Dept. Neurology, Yale University also Prof. Emeritus of Clinical Neurology, University College London will be speaking on the relationship between Dr Axel Munthe and the famous Professor Charcot of the Salpetriere in Paris.\\n\\nThe eminent architect, writers and former curator of Villa San Michele, Levente Erdeos will be giving a talk on “The makings of Villa San Michele, some connections to contemporary art and thinking”\\n\\nOther distinguished speakers include the Swedish author, Bengt Jangfeldt,Dr Peter Cottino from Capri, Mårten Lindståhl, Sweden, Dr.Katriona Munthe-Lindgren from London, and Prof.Alden Smith, Department of Classics, Baylor University Texas, USA.\\n\\nWhen Munthe received his medical degree in Paris in 1880 at the age of 23, he was the youngest Doctor of Medicine in Europe. His thesis was on the subject of gynaecology and obstetrics. Munthe had, however, been deeply impressed by the influential Professor Charcot in the field of neurology, and therefore already at an early stage was greatly interested in general diseases.\\n\\nIn the same year he opened his first practice in Paris, which was frequented mostly by members of the large Scandinavian colony of artists. He lived intermittently in Italy where he helped the cholera-stricken population (1880 on the island of Ischia, 1883 in Naples).\\n\\nIn 1887 Axel Munthe left Paris and settled in Anacapri where he worked as general practitioner. In 1890 he opened a practice in Rome where he was consulted by foreign dignitaries resident in Rome, as well as by Italian patients. He was appointed physician to the royal Swedish household to care for Crown Princess Victoria, later queen, from 1892 until her death in 1930.\\n\\nDuring the First World War Axel Munthe served as a physician in the British Red Cross at the front in France. He described his activities in the book, Red Cross & Iron Cross, which was published in London in 1916.\\n\\nAxel Munthe became a legendary physician who always gave free medical treatment to the poor. For some time he maintained a hospice for elderly, destitute people in a castle outside Rome. He was an outstanding psychologist who was extremely restrictive in prescribing treatment by drugs. The preferred forms of treatment prescribed by Munthe included hypnosis and therapy through music.\\n\\n\\nThe Story of San Michele entirely overshadows all other publications by Axel Munthe, although it includes much of what he had already written earlier. His very first publications covered a number of travel discourses which appeared in the Stockholm newspaper, Stockholms Dagblad, and which described his experiences of relief work during the cholera epidemic in Naples. These discourses came out in book form in Sweden in 1885, in England in 1887, and later in 1910 in Italy. Subsequently he wrote a number of other papers and short stories which were later collected and published: for example, Små Skizzer, published in Stockholm in 1888; Vagaries, London 1898; Memories and Vagaries, London 1908; Bref och Skizzer, Stockholm 1909; En gammal bok om manniskor och djur, Stockholm 1931; Vagabondaggio, Milan 1933; Ein altes Buch von Menschen und Tieren, Leipzig 1934, etc.\\n\\nHildasholm, the house that Axel Munthe built for his bride in 1910-1911, was designed by the architect Torben Grut (who would later create the Stockholm stadium). It lies amongst the trees on the edge of Lake Siljan in the heart of Dalarna.\\n\\n Surrounded by gardens and pine woods it looks over the peaceful\\nwaters and comprises Swedish, English and Italian furniture and paintings\\nfrom the 17th, 18th and 19th century Europe. It is still used by the family\\nwhile also being opened as a museum for the public during the summer\\nmonths. \\n\\nThe gardens were created by Axel’s wife Hilda on the promontories\\nand in the ravines surrounding the house where suddenly the well ordered\\nEnglish garden breaks into the wild and romantic natural environment.\\n\\n\\nFor a  full programme of the symposium please contact:.Pia Thunholm\\nStiftelsen Hildasholm,\\nBox 64\\nS-793 22 Leksand,\\nDalarna, Sweden\\nTel. +46 (0)247 10062\\nE-mail: munthes@hildasholm.org\\nhttp:// www.hildasholm.org\\n\\n\\nI hope this is of interest and would be grateful if the information was posted on your web.

       "       '\"I just think it\\'s interesting how many revisions this has gone through ... here\\'s the original 1911 \"\"Gutenberg\"\" encyclopedia article that I pasted here originally, that has had the so-called \"\"Islamic bias\"\" removed. I do know it needed editing, revising, expanding, and to be \"\"brought up to the times.\"\" Just something interesting to think about.\\n\\nALLAH, the Arabic name used by Moslems of all nationalities for the one true God. It is compounded of al, the definite article, and ilah, meaning a god.  The same word is found in Hebrew and Aramaic as well as in ancient Arabic (Sabaean).  The meaning of the root from which it is derived is very doubtful; cf.  Lane\\'s Arabic-English Lexicon, p. 82, and the Oxford Hebrew and English Lexicon, pp. 61 ff.\\n\\n== 2002 ==\\n\\nA previous version of the \"\"Allah\"\" article included the following:\\n\"\"Allah\"\" was also the proper name for the pre-Islamic god of the moon and travel worshiped by nomadic Arabic tribes. The name and has no femminine or plural forms. Allah was considered to be the ancestor and leader of the other gods, such as the goddesses al-Lat? and Man\\'at?\\n\\nAnybody know why was this removed?\\n\\nIt seems that the moon god theory is heavily disputed and has limited support. It appears to be based on the poor quality work of only one man (Robert Mory) in the last 10 years.\\n\\nWell, insofar as \\'Allah\\' doubles as the name \\'God\\' in Arabic we\\'re up against the problem solved in English by capitalization, capital G for the monotheistic god of the Jews and Christians (who prefers that we NOT use his first name) versus the gods with a small G. \"\"Allah\"\" was undoubtedly used about all SORTS of deities, and that\\'s where the Moon-deity argument falls down.  And watch out about publishing the female-trinity bit  isn\\'t that what got Salman Rushdie in trouble? Michael Tinkler.\\n\\nI authored the paragraph about the moon-god theory. I read about this in \"\"Islam\"\"  by Jamal J. Elias, a Muslim author. The book is an intorduction to Islam from the POV of a liberal Muslim scholar. As Elias is Associate Professor of Religion at Amherst College, Massachusetts, and he writes on this theory as if it were fact, it seems there is more to this picture than the \"\"poor\"\" work of one scholar. Therefore, I have restored the paragrah, with a note on it\\'s contoversy.\\n\\nI also authored the bit about Yahweh that was taken out. Critism accepeted, it belongs in its own article. So i have put it in Yahweh.  -  \\n\\nIt does seem true that Allah was the name of a moon god - and that Mohammed\\'s father had allah as part of his name. But the name does have a feminine form - al Lat. It is not clear the connection of the moon god to the Muslim god.\\n\\nOk, first of all: Allah does simply mean \"\"the god\"\", rather equivalent to our capitalized \"\"God\"\". Hence, any major god (like this moon god, apparently) would have very likely been called \"\"God\"\". I did some [admittely Internet-based] research on this topic just now, and clarified a few things in the actual text. Let me know how it reads now.\\n\\nHere\\'s a question. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, not a dictionary, so its articles should be about topics, not words per se. So is the \"\"Allah\"\" article the appropriate place to provide a discussion of the Islamic concept of God? My initial thought would be yes.\\n\\nBut Arabic-speaking Christians would use the word to refer to the Christian God. Does that complicate the issue? Maybe. But one might argue that the wikipedia is in English (this one at least), and in English the word \"\"Allah\"\" is generally used to refer to God specifically with reference to Islam. Right? So the discussion of the Islamic concept of God should be under \"\"Allah\"\". Does this make sense? Anyone disagree?\\n\\nAnother question - Do Muslims take Allah to be the personal name for God or just the Arabic language word meaning God. This could be tricky since by way of comparison some Christians take Yahweh to be the personal name of God while others see it as just another description \"\"I am what I am\"\" (If there is only one of a class, i.e. one God, why would he need a personal name?)\\n\\nWell. In the listing I have that is based on Hadith (the teaching tradition of Islam), Allah is listed as the first name among the 99 names.  The names read more like titles \"\"the Compassionate, the Merciful, etc.\"\", but the tradition is that they are names.  I\\'ll add the list as an entry. MichaelTinkler\\n\\nActually we already have a page under [[:ninety-nine names of Allah|ninety-nine names of Allah.\\n\\nRegarding: discussion of the Islamic concept of God\\n\\nI personally think the discussion of ',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\nHi again Bo [will just use the abbreviation for speed],\\nNot much time at the moment since I\\'m in the midst of a project but wanted to respond to a few points.\\nFirst of all, thanks for your kind, even-toned replies to my questions and expressions of  irritation. I DO think that WikiP should have an avenue of complaint for users  from my recent experience, it seems contributors can get stuck in an endless loop of Admins (or whatever titles you and your editorial colleagues have), never reaching someone with the authority to resolve complaints. You and others have referred vaguely to the \"\"process\"\" of Copyvio review, but I have no idea who does that, when they do it, or how to reach them to defend my position/claims.\\n1. I sometimes find a \"\"You have a message waiting\"\" notice. How is that genrated? Do you get this same notice when I post on your User page? Is there a way to send a messaage directly to you so it won\\'t be visible to the world  e.g. if I needed to provide you an email address or something I didn\\'t want posted here?\\n2. Regarding Crapsey. I did indeed check various sources in writing the article. And if you read the EB citation and my piece, you\\'ll see that mine is quite different, not at all a sentence-by-sentence paraphrase. It differs in style and wording from the outset to the end and contains far more detail than EB. Moreover, Crapsey is a local legend in Rochester, and I had no need to consult Brittanica  I don\\'t know how you folks access EB, but I stopped using it years ago when they went from a free to a pay service that only provides \"\"teaser\"\" articles that are virtually useless. Thus, the entry non-members get for Crapsey is the following truncated info:\\nhttp://www.britannica.com/eb/article?tocId=9125441\\nWe have never been EB \"\"trial\"\" members or subscribers; it would appear that you folks at WikiP do have some sort of membership, however. Is that correct?\\n3. Regarding Sock Puppetting, I was adapting your own WikiP term for those who use \"\"dummy\"\" accounts (or have friends act in concert with them) to insure they get the posting they want. It was beginning to appear that your colleagues were teaming up in a Revert War. In fact, they did just that in another article we posted about area poet William Heyen  they kept Copyvio-ing it, though in fact it was written by us for our own journal, Exit Online. When I pointed this out, I was told, in effect, \"\"Oh yeah? Well, prove it!\"\"\"\" I have no idea what sort of \"\"proof\"\" one can offer for owning someone one has posted to their own web site (or any other web site for that matter). More to the point, THEY offered no suggestions as to how one might \"\"prove it.\"\" If you have an email address for someone at WikiP who oversees this sort of stuff, then let me know and we\\'ll be happy to contact him/her.\\n4. As for \"\"my article,\"\" I was referring to the fact that it\\'s mine by virtue of the fact that I authored it. In fact, your own guidelines specifically state that the author of each edit is the author and has only granted a GFDL license, so that author can be said to be the owner of that particular edit. That could even be the whole article. For this reason, the authors don\\'t have to comply with the GFDL requirements for their own writing - the GFDL license doesn\\'t override their own rights to use their own work. They can also license it to any number of others under any other licenses they choose, since that\\'s one of the rights authors have.\\n5. Thanks for your candor over concerns about EB suits over copyright. Maybe EB has folks that spend their days doing nothing but monitor WikiP, though I somehow doubt it since they would not have access to the same \"\"new posting\"\" info that you and your colleagues use to monitor postings. It would take an army of staff even to randomly check WikiP listings.\\n6. As for creating an account, in fact, my colleagues and I do have accounts and would, indeed, like the \"\"credit\"\" for our efforts. However, given the recent unpleasant incidents we\\'ve encountered that include threats of being blocked/blacklisted, I\\'m sure you can understand why anonymity seems preferable for the moment.\\n7. I\\'ll have to check into templates. I suspected you might be using some sort of boilerplate, and this is precisely why using forms can be so dangerous.\\n \"',\n",

Incidentally I\\'m writing about UK law. American law used to be marginally different. For instance to have copyright in the UK you only have show your work to someone, whereas in America I think you have to send it to the Library of Congress - books anyway. Also you used to have claim copyright separately in different countries. Then there\\'s publishing rights, a whole different can of worms.\\n\\n:* I think that a picture such as Image:Pottsville court house.gif is liable to be a double copyvio - of the original postcard (if still in copyright) and of the gif image.\\n\\nGeneral.

I have been fairly active on new page patrol and on VfD, and I was active in the debates on the creation of WP:CSD criterion A7. I created . I have also been consistant in advocating strict application of the CSD, not favoring speedy tags on undesireable articles that do not quite meet the criteria.

You obviously don\\'t like JWs so why do you spend so much time thinking about us? Personally, I try to avoid thinking about things that I don\\'t like or that make me upset. Yet I notice that JWs and related articles are the only subject you deal with on WP. I doesn\\'t [sic] make any sense to me at all - what\\'s up with that! As it says on the WP main page, \"\"In this English version, started in 2001, we are currently working on 730,275 articles.\"\" Wouldn\\'t you be happier branching out to some of the other subjects on WP.

If you actually opened your eyes for once you would see I have problems with your religious leaders, not JWs. Although rank and file JWs are still responsible for selling their literature and promoting the false teachings of the Watch Tower commercial publishing organisation. \\n\\nYour second reality admittance is very revealing, you said: \"\"I try to avoid thinking about things that I don\\'t like or that make me upset.\"\" You sure do Danny, as do most JWs, and don\\'t think it hasn\\'t been noted by thousands of viewers of these pages. Very sad indeed when someone who claims he is part of the \"\"channel of God\"\", and \"\"the only narrow road to salvation\"\", shrinks back in fear whenever you see anything you don\\'t like. This is exactly why so many in this world get deceived and trapped in false religions, they just look away when reality comes knocking. This is also why you will most probably waste the rest of your life in a region that is not what it claims to be and lose your future opportunities with God through self-deception. Danny, never underestimate the power of denial, it will steal all your relationship with God, and you will probably let that happen.\\n\\nDanny, I will not argue with you, as you are not ready to see reality at present, I pray one day you will be able, but maybe that time is not yet.

       "       '\"\\n\\n== I believe in their Indoaryan Origin (or Iranians of India). ==\\n\\n\\nCertainly from what ive seen, read and experienced about Roma people i think that they certainly show close resemalance to similar Nomads of Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan and  just North India (not south India); yet i don´t agree that the historians or anthropologist should keep on mentioning India as the origin of their people, since India is to big a concept and ethnicity to do so. We must first encounter that really India as a concept is borrowing or a creation of the invading Aryans (indoeuropeans of iranian orign) that actually settled up north in between Pakistan and Afghanistan as the origin of this culture (later tu establish themselves in Rajasthan, Jammu-Kashmir, Guajarat and north-west regions basically to extend their culture)\\n\\nIt is precisly the regions of the \"\"Sindhu River\"\" between mountains of Afghanistan and the Pakistnian valleys of \"\"Kashmir\"\" and \"\"Punjab\"\" the real home of Hinduism and \"\"indoaryans\"\" (indoiranians).\\n\\nSo what i mean, is that if we talk about \"\"gypsy\"\" people we must talk not precisaly about India but first about Pakistani or Afghan-Iranian aryan culture and tribes that entered those regions invading the aboriginal populations and established a new culture.\\n\\nThat is why many people feel (i am one) that \"\"roma\"\" people have more connections to mesapotamia or semitic peoples since many forget to mention that indoarians (invading iranians) where culturally and ethnically closer to Semites, Huns and Greeks that came from Iran (a fusion between them peoples id say). \\n\\nPrecisly the Romani languague closely resembles Punjabi and Hindi yet more closer even to Pothohari and mountain languages of Pakistan and Afghanistan (were there are many nomadic tribes).\\n\\nThat is the reason why many gypsy dont look Indian (south indian atleast) but more Persian, Iranian, Kurdish, Dardic, Drokpas or Pashtu people and dont have dravidian traits of austrolid or asian origin; but certinaly resemble a mix of southern european mediteraneas (iranian-greek) mixed with semitic traits. M\\n\\nMany gyspys have long beards as how old nomadic VEDIC ARYANS (sun worshipers, budda etc) had; as well as have green eyes and a reddish tone to their skin like people for centuries where nomads in the mountain areas of Pakistan, North India and Afghanistan. What i mean to say is that they dress,look,act,and their music is more similar to people like the Kurds,Dards,Guajars,Pashtus,Pothoharis,Kashmiris and Punjabis than to dravidian-mongolian or austrolid indians.\\n\\nWe must also remember that the apperance of those nomadic indoeuropean (iranian) and others partly semitic-iranian-hun-greekish people; is how old ARYANS used to look like; add to that a reddish tone of skin since they lived in the mountains. \\n\\nThe dress of gypsy people closely resembles more Iranin or Afghan nomadi peoples. The tipical jewlery and earings of women nomads in those areas is one sign. Also the long hair used buy man plus earings close resembles those aryan conceptos of sunworshipping worriors that where great horse riders and metalsmiths who brought Cattle_Cows to the desert and tropical areas of Pakistan and India; that was how historically dravidians described those whiter skinned, mostage-bearded men that invaded their more asian-austroloid land.\\n\\n\\nI believe Gypsys or Roma are descendants of the \"\"Indoaryan\"\" of  orgin worriors of \"\"iranian origin\"\" that settled in the mountanous regions of Pakistan (Pothohari-Kashmir) and those who went into the deserts of Rajasthan (Rajputs-Jatts). I believe these people gatthered together to defend themselves from invading Muslims as did classical persiands; yet where defeated and pride got to them so they fled their land since they wanted to continue their concept of nomadic sunworshippers.\\n\\n\\nGypsyes do not resemble dravidian culturs but more Irani (Persian)Afghani(Pashtu)-Punjabi-Kashmiri-Rajasthani-Harayana-Brhamman cultures of indoeuropean or irani-scythian-greekish influence and language...\\n\\n\\nGypsy Music is not only resembled in the famous ZARDS, the primitive Tangos or Boleros of Romania, Hungary and Russia; and Flamenco or Cante Jondo but u can trace their indoaryan music in Country,Rock and Roll-Hippie Music, Fox Trot-Jazz; and ofcourse latin american rythms like: Rumba, Salsa, Bolero, Tango, Peruvian Valse, Tondero, Zamacueca, Charchalera, Milonga etc...\\n\\nIt errant living and the suffering of a worrior people that pridley did not accept the imposition of mongolian or muslim invaders; so they fled with their women and similar tribes of indoaryan origin into the western regions; saddly to know they to large and were not given any help they dedicated themselves to music, entertainment (circus-acrobats-scene players) and poets; yet they mained t',\n",

I\\'m glad the whole poll thing is over, but what is the overall conclusion: \\n\\n1. the naming committee will discuss on the matter of Macedonians/Macedonian Slavs name\\n2. Macedonian Slavs stays until another poll is organized or\\n3. a status quo for an indefinite period of time?\\n\\nSince you seem to be the only neutral admin actively engaged in this debate, it seem to me that you are the right person to ask these questions....  \\n\\n:If a poll doesn\\'t reach a decision, the poll is treated as moot and the status quo is continued. I agree that the name \"\"Macedonian Slavs\"\" is inappropriate (and many of the arguments made against using it were blatantly POV). The problem is that right now we don\\'t have a mechanism for ensuring that the name is decided objectively. I\\'ll have a chat with the other admins to see if anything can be done in the short term (bear in mind that the naming committee is just a proposal, it\\'s not been endorsed yet).   \\n::: I would like you to know that I appreciate your active involvement in the Macedonians/Macedonian Slavs issue, because if it is left to polls to decide such delicate matters, Wikipedia would soon degenerate. The English Wikipedia, and its mirror sites are the most important generators of the Macedonian Slavs term on the net - , which is much unfortunate, because it makes the term more \"\"common\"\" than it actually is. There was a brief period of some \"\"Macedonian Slavs\"\" references in BBC or CNN\\'s news articles (the first half of 2001), but they have withdrawn the term very soon. The naming committee is a good idea to resolve matters of this type, since the naming of the article itself is a specific NPOV question - the different POV\\'s can hardly be \"\"described\"\" in it. I don\\'t want to leave the impression that I\\'m trying to put a pressure on you, but please resolve this dispute in a reasonable period of time (that is, don\\'t forget about it -)). Thanks again for your contributions.  \\n\\n::Just remember that we need to figure out what is neutral, not what is objectively correct. A committee which \"\"votes\"\" on what is \"\"objectively correct\"\" will not get \"\"endorsed\"\". This is the kind of thing which probably cannot be decided by a committee. See Wikipedia:naming conflict.   \\n\\n:::I didn\\'t say we should decide what is correct, merely what the common usage is. What I\\'m arguing against is the use of arguments such as \"\"they don\\'t have a right to use this name\"\", which is what\\'s been happening so far. BTW, the link you provided doesn\\'t work - could you point me to the right place?   \\n\\n::Sorry about the red link thing. I was using it as a \"\"forward reference\"\". That is, I made a comment referring to a policy page BEFORE writing that policy page. I also oppose the use (in Wikipedia articles, anyway) of arguments like X doesn\\'t have the right to use the name Y. We can, of course, say that P rejects X\\'s use of the name Y.   \\n\\n=== The Naming Committee ===\\n\\nHi, it\\'s me again.

       "       '\"\\n\\n\\nWell, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can\\'t kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:\\n\\nIn recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. \\n\\n[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, \"\"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\"\" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” \\n\\nMuslims obviously don\\'t like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. \\n\\nIn Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  \\n\\nFunny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. \\n\\nIf you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? \\n\\nI am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? \\n\\nSorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2',\n",

The USA\\'s first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers\\' Party (Nazis), as shown by Dr. Rex Curry.  It was not an ancient Roman salute. Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the \"\"ancient Roman salute\"\" is a myth. A image search on the web for the “original pledge of allegiance” provides additional information.\\n\\nThe Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. Additional information is available in web searches for the text \"\"military salute became the Nazi salute.\"\"\\n\\nFrancis Bellamy (author of the \"\"Pledge of Allegiance\"\") and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel \"\"Looking Backward\"\") and Charles Bellamy (author of \"\"A Moment of Madness\"\") were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the \"\"Nationalism\"\" movement in the USA, the \"\"Nationalist\"\" magazine, the \"\"Nationalist Educational Association,\"\" and their dogma of \"\"military socialism,\"\" and Edward inspired the \"\"Nationalist Party\"\" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute. \"\"Nazi\"\" means \"\"National Socialist German Workers\\' Party.\"\" A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent \"\"S\"\" letters for their \"\"socialism.\"\"  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized \"\"S\"\" letter for \"\"socialist\"\" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens. \"\"  Additional information is available in image or text searches for “swastika secrets.” \\n\\nDr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas are based on the false belief that Nazis called their symbol a \"\"swastika.\"\"  German National Socialists did not use the word \"\"swastika,\"\" but called their symbol a \"\"Hakenkreuz.\"\"  \\n\\nRecently, one Wikipedia writer became wiser and improved the \"\"Roman salute\"\" article somewhat so that it recognizes and repeats some of Rex Curry\\'s discoveries. Other pledge and salute articles on Wikipedia are as bad as ever.\\n\\nThe Wikipedia article for the \"\"Roman salute\"\" used to be complete disinformation, deliberately maintained by phonies who tried to perpetuate myths. Here is an excerpt of what Wikipedia used to carry: \"\"The Roman salute is a closed finger, flat-palm-down hand raised at an angle (usually 45 degrees) and was used by the Roman Republic. It was also the historical civilian salute of the United States, from 1787?-1934?, known since 1892 as the Bellamy salute. It was also the historical salute among armies of the Middle East and South America.\"\" Wikipedia liars also used the painting \"\"The Oath of the Horatii\"\" as absurd support for a Roman connection. The foregoing is all incorrect and of course without any attribution nor support on the Wikipedia page because there is no support. It is not a Roman salute.  Yet, Wikipedia regulars allowed the disinformation, including the dates “1787?-1934?” with the question marks included, to remain posted on Wikipedia, while deleting anyone who tried to correct the propaganda.\\n\\nSimilar criticisms apply to the Wikipedia pages on Francis Bellamy, Edward Bellamy and the Pledge of Allegiance.\\n\\nWikipedia falsifiers use the misnomer \"\"public schools\"\" when they mean \"\"government schools\"\" and they both cover-up the Bellamys\\' desire to promote a government takeover of education, a desire to end all of the better alternatives, and to impose socialism (and what the Bellamys called \"\"military socialism\"\") within government schools. The Bellamys loved the military and wanted all of society to ape the military. Those points also help explain why Francis Bellamy enjoyed starting the pledge with a military salute.\\n\\nSome regular writers on Wikipedia knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of ',\n",

       "       '\"\\n\\nRegarding the writer at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_salute\\n    Mr Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers\\' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is \"\"covered up\"\" by people and also people often refer to it as the \"\"Nazi-Soviet\"\" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers\\' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand \"\"Nazi\"\" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers\\' Party referred to themselves as \"\"Nazis\"\" (they did not refer to themselves as \"\"Nazis\"\").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as \"\"It wasn\\'t invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word \\'socialism\\'!\"\"  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word \"\"Nazi\"\" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers\\' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the Nazi-Soviet pact page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase \"\"National Socialist.\"\" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand \"\"Nazi\"\" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers\\' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry\\'s historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers\\' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry\\'s point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment \"\"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It\\'s just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!\"\"   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name \"\"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics\"\" and also used the term \"\"Communist\"\" instead of using the term \"\"Socialist.\"\"  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether the salutes dictated particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers\\' Party, and Edward\\'s book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward\\'s dogma inspired \"\"Nationalism\"\" clubs worldwide including in Germany. \\n\\n    Yes, the \"\"Roman salute\"\" page did once contain innaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to start going on with his use of the term \"\"conspiracy.\"\" It\\'s just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.  \\n\\n    The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who \"\"became wiser\"\", by incorporating Professor Curry\\'s discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler\\'s article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.  Dr. Curry has also publicly challenged Martin Winkler to debate these issues.  Professor Curry\\'s discovery that the swastika/hakenkreuz, although an ancient symbol, was sometimes used by the National Socialist German Workers\\' Party as \"\"S\"\" shapes standing for its \"\"Socialism\"\" is also his own original work. And he is right that other writers have deliberately covered up the discovery (as the writer above admits) and have excluded it from the Swa',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n== More on Wiki writers http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html ==\\n\\nMany errors have been corrected in Wikipedia\\'s Roman salute article.\\nhttp://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html  The article had many visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page- as Dr. Curry attempted to correct the many errors.\\nhttp://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html\\n\\nHowever, the wikipedia article on the \"\"Roman Salute\"\" is becoming more dishonest by the week. An earlier version referenced the work of Professor Rex Curry and started thusly: \"\"The Roman salute is a gesture in which the arm is held out forward straight, with palms down. Sometimes the arm is raised upward at an angle, sometimes it is held out parallel to the ground. The salute was supposed to have been used in the Roman republic, but there is no clear evidence of this. Indeed it is not known whether salutes in the military sense existed at all in Roman culture\"\" (by Paul Barlow).  A more recent version of the same article is written as if a neo-Nazi has been covering-up again.\\n\\nA big initial problem is that no wiki writer will even attempt to discover the first use of the phrase \"\"Roman salute\"\" and thus the writers remain stuck in intellectually dishonest confusion about dates and origins.\\n\\nThe article reverts back to its earlier opening concessions to the work of Dr. Curry, conceding that there is no clear evidence of the salute in the Roman Republic and also conceding that there is no evidence of salutes in the military sense at all in Roman culture.\\n\\nThe wiki writer then engages in speculation that people today misunderstood some images from ancient Rome.  There is no support for the idea that the \"\"Roman Salute\"\" concept arose long ago from misinterpretations of Roman images.  There is as much evidence that, after Dr. Curry\\'s shocking discoveries about the salute\\'s origin with the Pledge of Allegiance, modern writers (including wiki writers) deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers misinterpreted Roman images in order to cover-up and suppress Professor Curry\\'s discoveries.  \\n\\nThe wiki writer then engages in speculation that neoclassical artists misunderstood some images from ancient Rome.  There is no support for the idea that the \"\"Roman Salute\"\" concept arose among neoclassical artists from misinterpretations of Roman images.  There is as much evidence that, after Dr. Curry\\'s shocking discoveries about the salute\\'s origin with the Pledge of Allegiance, modern writers (including wiki writers) deliberately looked for other explanations and then those writers seized upon neoclassical artists in order to cover-up and suppress Professor Curry\\'s discoveries.  \\n\\nFor example, there is no evidence that Jacques-Louis David actually thought that his painting \"\"The Oath of the Horatii\"\" represented an actual historical Roman salute.  All of the evidence indicates that David created the scene out of whole cloth for drama. All of the speculating otherwise is actually the machinations of wiki writers and people of their ilk. The intellectual dishonesty is all the more evident in that the wiki writers deliberately faill to address those very points already made by Dr. Curry http://rexcurry.net/pledgehoratii.html  Further, the Horatii painting depicts three people reaching for weapons.\\n\\nThe Tennis Court Oath was painted by David later, and repeats David\\'s use of the dramatic gesture that David concocted, but in a more modern setting.  There is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed. David was not there. Further, the oath was was written on paper (the paper being read by the central figure?) and the \"\"oath was taken\"\" by signing the document. There is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting (the central figure might be swearing, or he might be reading his document) while those people about him waive hats, talk, holler, point, etc.  Three figures on the left seem to be an inside reference to the Horatii painting.  The wiki writer is misrepresenting the works or reading into them.\\n\\nThe distribution of the Eagle Standards was painted by David even later, and repeats David\\'s use of the dramatic gesture that David concocted, but in another modern setting.  There is no evidence that it accurately depicts the event protrayed and there is no evidence that anyone is taking an oath in the painting at all.  The wiki writer claims that this is the mos important of these paintings.  That painting shows no use of the salute in pledging or oath-taking or at all and simply shows various people, with various gestures, acclaiming the central figure and grabbing for, and shouting for, the \"\"Eagle Standards.\"\"  The wiki writer is misrepresenting the works and reading into them.\\n\\nThe wiki writer then claims that other painters during the nineteenth century regularly depicted the straight-arm g',\n",

What specific health testing do you conduct on your dogs?\\n\\nYou, and those supporting your club/registry, have been respectfully asked for this information numerous times during this discussion yet you continue to ignore these legitimate requests, while appearing rude, insulting, superior-minded, and frankly an entirely offensive and inarticulate representative of this breed you \"\"founded\"\" and the other breeders affiliated with your registry.  I certainly hope other breeders affiliated with your organization do not present themselves to the public in the same way you do, as I can\\'t imagine anyone with any intelligence and self-esteem would be willing to tolerate such unprofessional behavior, much less purchase any puppies/dogs from people who conduct themselves the way you have in this discussion.\\n\\nYou claim a lot, but you provide no independent support for your claims, only your own writings on your own website.  You claim anyone \"\"producing\"\" dogs other than you or your registry are frauds, yet you are unwilling to prove how this is true other than offering some photos YOU have taken of these dogs and your own rantings, as evidence. You claim breeders unaffiliated with you are \"\"in it for the money\"\", yet:\\n\\nYou produce more of these dogs than almost all other breeders combined, through your wholly and co-owned breeding dogs.  Your website (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/upcoming_litters.htm) for this Winter alone, shows you are \"\"producing\"\" ELEVEN litters at New Zion and through co-ownership breedings.  Eleven litters, even conservatively speaking, could easily produce over 100 PUPPIES!  And, you are planning for 20 more litters next Spring and Summer!  You also currently list over 25 stud dogs and over 25 females you are considering for breeding!\\n\\nYou charge a lot of money for each puppy you produce ($900-$2500+).  After the puppy-buyer has paid you for a puppy from a certain litter, you also contractually reserve the right, at your own discretion, to substitute a puppy from another \"\"compatible\"\" (again, based on your own determination) litter and you will not provide a refund if they are do not agree with the \"\"substitute\"\" puppy you decide to offer them.\\n(see: http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm.....\"\"New Zion reserves the right to substitute any litter of equal/higher value that is compatible with your exact requirements\"\").\\n\\nIt appears that, once monies are given are given to you, your contract does not allow for any refund under any circumstances, nor could I find any instances where you contractually assume any financial responsibility whatsoever for any puppies you \"\"produce\"\" who display congenital/hereditary problems requiring resulting astronomical/extensive veterinary fees.\\n  \\nYou require your puppy-buyers to not only pay you for puppies at the time you \"\"produce\"\" them, but you also require puppy-buyers to sign contracts promising future puppy and breeding rights (for breedable dogs, you require the dog\\'s new owners to either give you some of the puppies that dog produces in the future and/or you require they allow you to use that dog in the future to sire new litters of your own), in order to profit from the dog not only now but also throughout his/her life. \\n\\nYou have no stated policy on your website page (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm) re: your own personal policy/commitment to rescue and make/find a home for for any of the puppies/dogs you \"\"produce\"\", should they become unwanted, homeless and/or end up in shelters or in abusive situations.\\n\\nYour \"\"Policies and Prices\"\" make no mention of a contractual requirement by you (with the signed contractual commitment of your puppy-buyers) to spay/neuter their new \"\"pets\"\", in order to reduce overpopulation of this breed and dogs, in general.

Nathaniel, I think you have pointed out one of the most fascinating double edges of the internet, and certainly this frustrating Wikipedia. (please forgive me taking this time here, but for the sake of your welding article case, might I be so bold to attempt advancing a much, much larger cause as well) \\n\\nYou have said yourself, that you are not a highly experienced \"\"welder\"\", save for I\\'m sure at least some time spent laying down a few good beads, yet you haven\\'t been known to build large constructions where lives might have depended?  I have that right about you, yes?  \\n\\nHOWEVER, what you have done through this string of welding articles, I find simply fantastic.  It is concise and worded at a level properly aimed at most anyone already competent enough to begin welding, yet simply needs to get the overview.  It is as authoritative as any single, or group of books and articles I\\'ve read on welding as a hole. (That should encourage, and scare you at the same time). Now we just need to add a bit more about the Art.  Yes, that ethereal bane stalking wikipedia bureaucrats who can\\'t stand things which don\\'t come up in google counts.\\n\\nThe list of unsourced statements you have offered, may exist in no small part, to the very lack of \"\"authoritative\"\" sources available for such things.  I have never, NEVER come across two welding books which are consistent through a \"\"school of thought\"\" on such a list of interdependent items.  It is precisely the effect of deep interrelation, that no two instructors will ever approach welding exactly the same, yet \\'miraculously\\' so many welds hold together and perform their needed functions in our lives.  After the instructor has pointed out the canvas, paints and brushes, than he must leave the student to his own devices.  To hone a skill set, to practice an art.  Practice.  For ultimately, the welders experience becomes the most reliable gauge to deciding the finished quality of a weld.  So practice and time under the hood is everything \"\"so they say\"\".  \\n\\nX-Ray is really quite impractical for all but the most over-funded projects.  Destruction, by cross-cutting open the weld or simply trying to break it, is what the most honest instructor will tell a student he must do if he wants to know (learn) what it takes to make a good weld.  Breaking things, is the engineeres absolute best instruction manual, and he/she must hold in great regard and memory, those times where they witnessed failure, so better to prevent it.  That is what truly builds experience, and it is only the experienced person who has any hope of mastering any art.\\n\\nA highly technical, well sourced, and cited article such as this, MUST in some way acknowledge that the details will only go so far before it must address that which I have seen turn the stomach of so many a geekzoid wikipedian.....   those chanting the endless mantra of NPOV and that shit-source of false surety, google counts; That there are people out there who know more than google.  And there always will be.  That these articles, if wikipedia wishes to survive, if wikipedia ever wishes to be more than an ARTIFICIAL intelligence, it must learn to allow by tolerance alone of need be, or better yet, to encourage those who have deep knowledge into feeling more comfortable here.  To collaborate, to offer their thoughts and experience here, to celebrate the diversity of opinion, and even the how-tos and what-fors wherein work can be done with great satisfaction and supreme result, for all.\\n\\nThis largely tedious, wasteful, foolhardy, and pointless absolute fixation around which too many wikipedians have styled themselves as NPOV warriors, by demanding citation on every minute single detail, will be this wiki\\'s undoing.   \\n\\n*From my experience, the arc is held simply as short as possible so as to concentrate heat in the shortest possible time, yet long enough to avoid dipping the tip while the hand naturally shakes minutely.  The amount of heat, the amount of heat the power-supply can deliver (over time, and becomes and very important factor in calculating \"\"duty-cycle\"\") to the weld pool, and thus how convex or concave the pool is laid with filler, defines (for me) how close I can get to the work.  Duty Cycle, is a calculation of the machines ability to deliver a given heat, for a given time, vs. the time it must literally rest idle before it has radiated or cooled the internal workings of the machine, completely irrespective of the work piece. Yet this largely defines the maximum amount of heat, to a given thickness, in a \\'shortness\\' of time that a welder can put into the work piece.  Aluminum for example is notorious for its ability to \"\"wick\"\" (conduct) heat away from the p',\n",

All in all I think this is a good parody of the gamer lifestyle, but unfortunately the misguided masses of preteens will attempt to emulate it further than they do on their own.  Online gaming is bad enough these days without stirring up that particular cesspool any more than needed.  In the end, it makes me yearn for the days of my youth when Quake\\'s seperate online client was released.  Those were days when people would actually have intelligent conversation until the server filled up enough for a good game of CTF. (and that was before there even WAS a flag... it was a key)  Now, it\\'s all n00b fagz0rz l0ll0rz!!!11!!!1one and corpse humping until you get bored and leave.

I earlier emailed this draft to Rob Speer and Joe Hall for comment, and just sent it out to Sean Black. \\n*PM 2. I noticed that I am also blocked from the RfC page. I have not had much time to investigate what the intention of that page is, since I am writing my email to the professors, so I don't know whether that page or being blocked from it is important.\\n*PM 3. It is not true that I only editted pages on myself.\\n*PM 4. Who hold that contacting a professor would be the same as contacting an employer, neglect my earlier comment that I approach the issue from the angle of the integrity of science. The proper reaction is not to neglect it but give the argument why this angle would be improper. \\n*PM 5. On the RfC Joe Hall suggests that my objective would be to punish him or so. No, I only suggest that the professor and he discuss the situation from the angle of the integrity of science. Earlier I wrote that this would be very beneficial for him. \\n*PM 6. Joe mentioned that Hal Varian no longer is the dean at SIMS. Thus the draft needs at least one change.\\n*PM 7. I told everyone that I wanted a time out. Why don't you respect that wish ? Didn't I read somewhere that a truce was also an option ? \\n\\n\\nDear Mr. Black,\\n\\nI saw that, while I was composing my letter to the professors at MIT and SIMS, further action on wikipedia about me. There is an RfC which I am not familiar with and now you seem to have been blocking me whatever that is. \\n\\nBelow you find the draft text of my letter to the professors. If you think that this is threatening and not befitting a scientific community, please reply.\\n\\nA few hours ago I already sent this draft text to Rob Speer and Joe Hall. With an introductory text, that I no longer have, since wiki-mail has no cc. But they might forward the email sent to them.\\n\\nI would appreciate it if you could explain the problem and what I can expect.\\n\\nPlease see also my recent edit of Arrow's impossibility theorenm.\\n\\nMy regards,\\n\\nThomas Colignatus\\n\\n\\nDRAFT\\n\\nTo the president of MIT\\nProfessor Susan Hockfield\\nhttp://web.mit.edu/hockfield/\\nhockfield@mit.edu\\n\\nTo the dean of SIMS, University of California at Berkeley\\nProfessor Hal Varian\\nhttp://www.sims.berkeley.edu/~hal/\\nhal@sims.berkeley.edu\\n\\n\\nMarch 11, 2006\\n\\n\\n\\nDear professors Hockfield and Varian,\\nDear Hal,\\n\\nI have a problem on the integrity of science with two of your students, Rob Speer at MIT who started the problem, and Joseph Lorenzo Hall at SIMS who is interfering in an unhelpful way. The problem is summarized in the appendix.\\n\\nObviously, the integrity of science is a difficult subject even for academics so there must be a great deal of tolerance with students. With students, they certainly cannot be held accountable as scientists can, and they are only learning the trade. Yet, students e.g. know that one cannot cheat a test and that one must study a topic before one gives conclusions on it. When issues of integrity arise, it can be very educational for them to have the issue discussed. In this case, these two students would learn a lot about scientific conduct and scientific integrity.\\n\\nIn the present case, the issue is on the behaviour of these students on the internet, in particular wikipedia. It appears that communication with these students is greatly hindered by that environment, which does not allow the quality of deliberation provided by a personal chat with a person that they respect. My reason to contact you is to ask you to find a teacher or counselor at your school to have that chat.\\n\\nIt is to be considered whether the activity of those students within wikipedia is related to their life as students at your schools. My impression is that this relation exists. Firstly, they present themselves on their wikipedia pages as students of MIT and SIMS, thus partly referring to those institutions and their education there, implying their relation to you. Secondly, they are active in editing work, where they refer to learned books and where they use difficult words. Their behaviour thus cannot be strictly separated from their education and prospective position as scientists. This is most clearly so with Joseph Lorenzo Hall who is already a Ph.D. student who thus must write scientific papers for the journals. For Rob Speer, who started the problem, it can be observed that his education on computing science is relevant for the topic where the problem arose. \\nIn the end, it is with\",\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n== links ==\\n\\nDharmabum420 and others seem to enjoy removing links from the article. I am not a webmaster or even know one. I found the site outside the wall on my space, and since then have found it to be quicker on posting news and tour info then any of the other sites. I think it deserves a link here with the others. I must admit, I messed up the link by missing a few rules to begin, but since then have fixed that. Dharmabum420 said it seemed self promotion, well I simply just copied the title of the page, it is not self promotion. Since then I have written what features the site holds, but it continues to be removed. Google stats do not legitimate how good a site is for info, and this is NOT a rule by Wikipedia, so stop treating it as one. Thank you, please keep the link \\n:I would suggest the link be removed until a consensus can be reached here.\\n:I\\'ll assume that it\\'s not self-promotion despite the earlier \"\"greatest site ever!\"\" type description, but regardless, I would personally argue against the inclusion of the site, for a variety of reasons:\\n:#Wikipedia is not a link repository, and guidlines suggest only one fan site for such an article, and we already have far more than that.\\n:#No Google hit within the first 100 links in a \"\"pink floyd\"\" search and no Alexa rating; while not a set policy on Wikipedia, such rankings are often used to determine a site\\'s notability when trying to decide whether to include the site in an article already well-stocked with other, high-rated sites.\\n:#The only content on the site that is not easily available on far more popular sites is a selection of photos of people\\'s tattoos. While mildly interesting, it\\'s hard to argue that it increases the value of the Pink Floyd article itself, as few people who read the article will be searching it out for information on Pink Floyd tattoos.\\n:#Much content on the site is commerical, marketing T-shirts and the like. This is clear in the discography, which holds no information other than a simple list of the albums (available on Wikipedia itself anyway) with links to purchase them to an Amazon seller account.\\n:#The site in question is very low-quality compared to the rest of the resource links; confusing, messy and difficult to navigate, intrusive music with no way of turning it off, and it has major compatibility problems with Firefox 1.5 and Safari (perhaps others, that\\'s what I\\'ve got to try).\\n:That\\'s my 2¢ on this particular site. - a \\n\\n::I\\'ll double \\'s 2¢ and even add in another penny to make it an even nickel. It\\'s a very sub-par site and doesn\\'t contribute anything to this article.  \\n\\n::I will disagree with both of you. while you claim only one fan site is appropriate, it clearly states \"\"Note: fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included.)\"\" this fansite is very imformative and has more details on wanted details. For example, this site has details about a On an island live dvd with a direct link to saying David will record the rah shows for a dvd. Visit the other sites, none of them have this info and this is just one instance. You are wrong about it being the normal material. Also after paying attention to this site for sometime, it has continued to be the first in announcing tour dates for Rogers tour, and apparently has already secured a interview with one of Rogers bandmates. While you may think that the videos on the site are annoying, many fans love this. I am one of them, I cant think of another site where I can view much of the videos on this site. You say its difficult to navigate and I laugh at that, there is a simple naviagtion bar at the left hand side of each page, just like fleeting glimpses bar. Also every site has a discography, but very few have a videography, this alon makes this site better then most. So it has some comercial availability...so what? It still is a great source of info. Your google pink floyd rankings are a joke. 80 out of the first 100 are not updated and far subpar then this site. I wonder how many people search for pink floyd tattos, probably far more then you think, because I for one know of no other site that has this, and I have picked a tat from the site to get myself. This site deserves a link and I disagree with both of you\\n\\n:: Also now that I think about it, show me another site that streams Davids mermaid gig, or has each of his promo videos for tracks of the new album? Not even DG.com has those avaialable anymore. Also how about the interview on the Roger waters tour page? Link the other fansite that has this. None do. This site was also the first that had Rogers complete touring band lineu',\n",

Returning to the discussion about the coint,,,uhhh guys Hannibal is Phoenician(Caanite,Yemen Migrents) Caanite(yemen Migrents Berber(yemen Migrents) Carthaginian Arab\\n\\nBerbers: \\n\\nBerbers are the original and first inhabitants of North-Africa, in other words, they are the natives of this part of Africa. The name by which they are called (berbers) comes from the noun \"\"barbarians\"\" (in english). And this, because Romans used to call All those who didn\\'t speak their language  \"\"barbarians\"\"... And actually, there are only us who are still called like this ^_~ why did they use this term, they just use this noun without any feeling of a pejorative meaning. But to call themeselves in their language (Tamazight), they use \"\"imazighen\"\": the plural of \"\"Amazigh\"\". \\n\\nMany people ask about our origins, and I always say that this question is sensless! it\\'s like asking what is the origins of the Indians! Indians Don\\'t have the same eyes as chinese but they are considered as asians so Just think about us (it\\'s an order!) that We are berbers Thus we are Africans! \\n\\nDon\\'t forget that those who first were called africans were berbers, when you study about Rome and byzantine at school, you\\'ve probably heard about carthage and africans? these africans were the great Phoenicians,Berbers (arabs). Hence the Carthaginian Arabs. \\n\\nBut we can answer to which race the berbers belong to, As you know (I\\'m sure you don\\'t know!^^\\') there are 3 races in the world: \\n\\nThe Caucasoid race (Europeans, Jews/hebrews, Arabs ...etc.) \\n\\nThe Negroid Race. (Blacks) \\n\\nThe Mongloid Race. (chinese, japanese ...etc.) \\n\\nBerbers are predominately Caucasoid (berbers of the sahara are mixed with sub-saharans), Their language is close to the Language spoken by the old egyptians (Pharaohs...), in other words they speak an Afro-asiatic language (Hebrew, Arab, assyrian, Old egyptian, Berber...etc.) SEMETIC! XD \\n\\nTo see how berbers look like click google \\n\\nTo know how berber language sounds (through music) download this MP3 by clicking google \\n\\nThe lands where berbers lived in the past, were from the west of Old Egypt to the Canary-islands, But now, Berbers constitute only 25% of the population in Algeria and 40% in morocco, the berbers of the canary islands (called guanches) are spanish now and they\\'ve lost their language. \\n\\n[urlhttp://imazighen.proboards40.com/index.cgi?board=history&action;=display&thread;=1123104351[/url] \\n\\n\\n\\nGENETICS And Origins of Berbers \\nOrigins of Berbers: \\nFinal Genetic Make Up: \\nMtdna: \\n***** \\nNorth african cromagnoid Ibero-maurusian (U6): about 15% \\n\"\"Iberian\"\" mtdna (H, pre HV, V...etc.): 60%-80% \\nSubsaharan Mtdna: 2%-20% \\n\\nY-dna: \\n***** \\nCapsian (E3b2)  60-80 % \\nArab (J*): 10-300% (30% in tunisians!) \\nSubsaharan: 3%-8% \\nRECENT European: 0-%10% \\nBerber DNA Tested \\n\\nGenetical Studies begin to be done on berbers, Be happy! YIPEEE p \\n\\nHere is the Berber DNA compared to other ethnics: \\n\\n\"\"So far, our analyses have allowed a clear dissection of almost all NW African...paternal lineages into several components with distinct historical origins. In this way, the historical origins of the NW African Y-chromosome pool may be summarized as follows: 75% NW African Upper Paleolithic (H35, H36, and H38), 13% Neolithic (H58 and H71), 4% historic European gene flow (group IX, H50, H52), and 8% recent sub-Saharan African (H22 and H28).\"\" (Bosch et al., Am J Hum Genet, 2001) * * * Caucasoid mtDNA (maternal) sequences, labeled L3E and U6, were detected at frequencies of 96% in Moroccan Berbers, 82% in Algerian Berbers and 78% in non-Berber Moroccans, compared with only 4% in a Senegalese population. (Rando et al., Ann Hum Genet, 1998) * * * \\n\\nWhile the origins of the Sumerians, whose language appears related to no known linguistic family, remain a mystery, the other people of the region were chiefly Semites - Canaanites (the Levant), Amorites (southwestern desert people), Akkadians and Assyrians (Mesopotamia), Arameans, Habiru (Hebrews) and Bedu (Beduin Arabs of the southern desert). The languages of these groups are closely related, and also related more distantly to Hamitic languages, which include ancient Egyptian, Coptic, and Ethiopian.\\n\\nThroughout the Bronze Age there was a sporadic influx of nomads from Arabia into the area, hostile at first, but soon incorporated into the existing culture. Later, Indo-European peoples migrated into the area. Among them were the Hurrians, who moved from Turkey in the North to Iraq in the 3rd milleneum BCE and brought the light horse-drawn chariot and composite b',\n",

       "       '\":: uhhh, we could also add Standford Shaw on the list and last time I checked, he was a western scholar. As for the rest of your text Mr. Kojian, the fact of the matter remains that there is no concrete evidence written or otherwise that the Ottoman goverment of the time gave explicit or even implicit instructions to exterminate the community of Armenians for racial reasons. Until a time comes where there is substantiative proof that such instructions were given, it is totally misleading to coin the term genocide to the tragic events that unfolded in 1915-16. And it doesnt matter if there were a zillion eyewitnesses who funny enough all turn up to be christians, the most famous of which was Lepsius the racist protestant who was obsessed with preserving the \"\"good image\"\" of Germany.  \\n\\n::: No evidence?  Oh brother.  Have you read the article?  Believe me, every Armenian in Anatolia did not commit suicide to make Muslims look bad, and Germany look good.  I\\'m glad you admit though that you don\\'t care if there were a zillion eyewitnesses, since you know better than the people who saw it with their own eyes.   \\n\\n:::: I dont think you get my point which is that your sources of the period in question may very well have been biased maybe? You have to get rid of the typical mindset of  if it supports the genocide thesis, it must be an objective, unbiased source! If not, it has to be someone that is in the Turkish goverment payrolls! This approach of yours and most of those that support the genocide thesis is far from being constructive and is one of the reasons that this issue is not being addressed properly!  \\n\\n::::: Addressed properly? Go ahead and address this.  Did the population of Armenians in Anatolia drop from around 2 million to around zero during WWI and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey?  And did that drop in population take place due directly to actions of Ottoman/Turkish authorities?  Yes or no.  No maybes, no yes but, no nothing else. There is no justification for genocide, and we don\\'t even need Christian eyewitnesses to tell us that the Armenians are gone - while the Turks and Kurds were fruitful and multiplied.   \\n\\n:::::: First of all your figure on the number of Armenians in Anatolia is grossly exagerated, Ottoman census figures before the war put the total at below 1 million in the eastern provinces. Even the Armenian patriarchate put the figure slightly above a million so I dont know where you dug that ridiculous sum from (could be your mind playing tricks which happens when you are exposed to too much propaganda)! As for the numbers dropping close to zero, if its the eastern provinces you are referring to, its what seems to have happened as a result of relocation. Have you even bothered to read through the information provided from the Ottoman archives in the links under the section on those that oppose the genocide thesis? If not, it would very well explain your flawed opinion on this subject!  \\n\\nIn theory the edit is not so bad. But the problem is that it only gives credance to those that say the events aren\\'t \"\"settled\"\". There needs to be an equal amount of discussion on those that say these things did happen, at the very least. And, to be honest, the edit just throws names around - there\\'s nothing in the articles to say that they have a particular position.  \\n\\n: Hellooo, this is the OPPOSITION section of the article. You can include the names of \\'scholars\\' accepting it in the academic recognition section, I\\'ve no problem with that. These scholars exactly say the following in their declaration (word-by-word) \"\"The weight of evidence so far uncovered points in the direct of serious inter communal warfare (perpetrated by Muslim and Christian irregular forces), complicated by disease, famine, suffering and massacres in Anatolia and adjoining areas during the First World War. Indeed, throughout the years in question, the region was the scene of more or less continuous warfare, not unlike the tragedy, which has gone on in Lebanon for the past decade. The resulting death toll among both Muslim and Christian communities of the region was immense. But much more remains to be discovered before historians will be able to sort out precisely responsibility between warring and innocent, and to identify the causes for the events which resulted in the death or removal of large numbers of the eastern Anatolian population, Christian and Muslim alike. \"\" Source: New York Times May 19, 1985. \\n\\n::And why sho',\n",

The show page could serve as the page for the main character and I wouldn\\'t have a problem with it. \\n\\n== Comments on Mediation ==\\n\\nadded comments at [ Mediation Cabal#Comments from an outsider-Steven McCrary]\\n\\n \\n\\n== Major Restructuring ==\\nMajor resturcturing of this article was long overdue.  The article was almost entirely one long, long section, ironically called \"\"Overview\"\".  I completely restructured this article to be more in line with the common Wikipedia structure used for other television programs.  Most notably The Simpsons and M*A*S*H (TV series) were used as examples of shows that were very popular and well organized.  I attempted to use logic in the categries and their order.  This reorganization was definitely needed, but it meant a lot of the content had to be moved around but I did not remove any content (yet) (except for correcting the episode of The Danny Thomas Show as being the pilot.  It was the basis for the a new show, possibly categoried as a spin-off, but it wasn\\'t a pilot episode of TAGS).  \\n\\nI added some new content but I did not remove existing content because I figured this restructuring was such a major change that I figured to take one step at a time.   Please note that I did not move everything.  All content that was not moved (most of it) was left where it was but the section was renamed \"\"Commentary\"\".  I did not want to change too much all at once.  Much of that content is indeed commentary (not strictly factual) but some of it is still needs to be moved to more appropriate sections or deleted if duplicate information.\\n \\n\\n::Thanks for the hard work.  I wanted to work on this some time ago, but because of the situation recounted above that went to the Mediation Cabal and the \"\"truce\"\" proposed I have been reluctant to make any changes here.  Nice to see others are of the same mind.   \\n\\n::Yeah, it looks a lot better.  Just prior to its restructuring, I added a bunch of stuff to fill out the article, because it seemed a little light (for as popular a show as it is), and also simply because the Sheriff Andy Taylor link redirects here, but there was very little content about the character on this page.  But I didn\\'t know where to put anything, so I just kind of stuck stuff here and there.  I hope I didn\\'t add any duplicate information. Please feel free to move it around or take it out if it isn\\'t necessary.  \\n\\n== New (Big) Problem re: Episodes List ==\\nThe list of Andy Griffith episodes was apparently started in October 2005.  Many different people have worked hard on it, and it has always been the only episodes list linked to from The Andy Griffith Show.\\n\\nAs I was revising the structure of The Andy Griffith Show (see above) I noticed that the list of episodes was actually misnamed.  It is, and has always been, located at List of Andy Griffith Show episodes.  Please notice that the mistake is that the word \"\"The\"\" was missing from the title (The name of the show is \"\"The Andy Griffith Show\"\").  Noticing this I decided correct the problem by moving the article to include the word \"\"The\"\" in the title, and I later planned on correcting the link on the main show\\'s article.  However when I tried this I was surprised to discover that I couldn\\'t do that because another article was already named List of The Andy Griffith Show episodes (with the \"\"The).\\n\\nThrough dumb luck (or bad luck) I discovered that another user had started creating an list of Andy Griffith episode on their own, under their username where nobody else knew it existed.  This article was started after the original and was basically hidden from others.  Just this month the user that created the alternate episodes list moved their article to List of The Andy Griffith Show episodes, although the main show\\'s article still doesn\\'t point to it.\\n\\nSo there\\'s the situation.  We\\'ve got two lists of episodes.  What to do?  Pros and Cons while staying neutral:  The original list is mistitled but has always been the only list linked to from the main article at The Andy Griffith Show.  Because it was always public more different people have worked on it.  The newer article is almost as old but it was \"\"hidden\"\" in a user area until just this month.  I will admit that the newer article looks nicer in style, structure, colors, etc. but IMHO I think the descriptions are better in the older, public list,',\n",

It could be interesting. \\n:If you have something to say, say it so, but use your own words idea and language instead of making a copy paste of my entire edit, as you have nothing at all to add to it and in fact seems clearly to don\\'t know what to say. \\n:So do the wisest, just shut up! \\n:It is in fact evident that you do not have understood one word of what has been sayed, and as you can see, repeating it indefinitely like rot speach, is not going to give you the ability to understand. \\n:All you do is agressing agressing personal attacks and agressing. \\n:Try to use half as much of your energy to understand what this is about and I am sure that you might see some light. \\n:I do not think that my statements can be make clearer than they already are and that your reaction, more than a physical unhability to comprehend, expose your reticence at accepting things you just dont want to accept. \\n:You cannot accuse me of talking in circle when you are the one doing so as it can be very clearly seen in your edit. \\n:As for you stupid accusation of me not being >sophie, what about you? Are you VAL? or are you rama? or are you DGL626, there is a lot of nick name on wiki, and all of them cover up a real name. \\n:They are all a pseudonym, meaning they are anonymous. \\n:So if I take the name \"\"anonymous\"\" as a pseudo, I will be as hiding and as showing as you are, because at the end, in both case it is a pseudonym with nothing to do with the person real name and identity.\\n\\n:So what are you trying to proove, except the fact that you were unable to figure what I just told you on your own? \\n:I had a name, this name seems now to be unavailable, and I dont feel to make it again or take another. \\n:Following wiki rules all are equal on wiki, old rats as well as newbees (hahaha) and even arb com and board members and admi are as equal as usual wikipedian, thought they have much more power than them and abuse of this power constantly without bad conscience, and have learn to twist and bend all wiki rules behond recognition, so who are you trying to fool with your wiki neutrality and wiki equality, who is wikis first rule? \\n:It is all a lie. \\n:How can you claim equality with another if you have more power than this other and power on this person and can exclude this person from the group? \\n:It isnt equality it is power struggle. \\n:It is adversity, and supremacy and group pressure as here. \\n:WIKI is oppression and extinction of the freedom of expression, it is so corrupt that not one admi found it disturbing nor strange to banish or revert a user edit to impose his own point of view, on the sacro sankt name of wikis neutrality and equality!\\n\\n:HA HA! \\n:Make me laught, but dont think you can trick me at believing such lies. \\n:Please, in the future, avoid using words that you do not fully understand, as \"\"logic\"\". \\n:For your knowledge english is one of the easiest language to learn so stop affirming stuff like that gratuitiously, do some research first. \\n:I speak 9 languages: \\n:English, danish, french, german, norvegian, swedish, occitan, latin, greek, and geek!\\n\\n:5 of them fluently, the others as pocket use.

       "       '\"\\n\\n::If the Manx are identified as a separate ethnic group, then why aren\\'t the Channel Islanders?  You want so much to believe that the Normans aren\\'t related to the English that you omit them from the related groups section, but keep the Bretons who aren\\'t even part of the British Isles.  In fact; archaeology confirms that the Bretons left Britain as Salian Franks were among the Nordic invaders when Rome fell.  TharkunColl says that the Normans aren\\'t related, but you say that the Channel Islanders do not constitute a separate ethnic group.  Where is the consistency of logic in those assumptions, which defies consensus outside of your joint control of this article?  Things are much different in the wide world of academia and scholasticism.  Well, Channel Islanders speak a language closer to English than any Celtic tongue.  Why is that a bad thing; why does negative POV have to be accepted?  Now, who is fantasising about the Dark Ages again?  Why would the Normans of the Channel be excluded, when they are HM the Queen\\'s loyal subjects?  Remember what they endured for us during WWII, which the Celtic nations did not have so bad...  When has Brittany declared their loyalty these past 500 years?\\n\\n::At least insular Normandy is still with us and this is a fact that TharkunColl especially hates beyond all doubt, since it means that England still has a major toehold of continual ethnic relations with France (while Hanover has come and gone).  He is upset because he views the French relationship to be unfair to England, but has no qualms about that in relation to English \"\"oppressive influence\"\" on Celtic speakers with special help by German princes.  The same POV TharkunColl uses to exclude the French is that which the Irish use to exclude the English.  The question is, why would you do something to others if you do not want it done to yourself?  (TharkunColl claims that he is not bound by the Golden Rule, since he is not Christian) The solution is for English and Irish nationalists to not act this way at the Wikipedia.  Wikipedia is not a vehicle for these types of POV; these Balkanist notions.  When discussing ethnic relatives, the Channel Islanders are a mutual bridge between the English and French.  This is confirmed by all academics and scholars; that you two fringe-theorists disagree is of no consequence to the world at large.  On this page, there are several objections to your dual consensus, but TharkunColl calls them fantasy.  Why don\\'t we all gang up on you Francophobes together?\\n\\n::You keep the French out because of this Hanoverian fringe who says the English are Germans.  He supports the errant belief that Hanover is where the English come from as opposed to where Denmark\\'s old sphere of influence was and before the Holy Roman Empire and/or Kingdom of Germany existed.  German princes have no roots in England at allthey have only been recent and foreign: Habsburg, Orange-Nassau, Oldenburg (now Mountbatten), Hanover and Saxe-Coburg-Gotha (now Windsor).  When George changed to Windsor, it did not conceal the true nature of the monarchyneither did the Bombing of Dresden in Saxony have that effect of integrating these Germans.  The more they try so hard to be accepted, the further our people have rejected their status as our Sovereigns.  There have never been so culturally and socially unpopular royalty in the history of the British Isles, yet for some political reasons...others feel it is necessary to make a stalemate by using a straw man fallacy against the Anglo-French fusion which has been witnessed in posterity; by noting that the Germans are an unpopular choice for inclusionall the while saying that Hanover is where the English people are from.\\n\\n::Please, let historical precedent decide who is a part of the English people vs who is only in governmental or political relation/alliance as a result of religious divisions and Parliamentary dictation of Royal affairs ever since the time of colonialism and especially 1603.  Henry VIII of England neither liked Martin Luther and his Prussian/Hanseatic culture, nor was Anne of Cleves going to provide an heirby choice of a King desparate for heirs.  That was the sentiment of the people, whom if Protestant had some Calvinist/French (Huguenot, Puritan) leanings to the exclusion of others.  Wesley\\'s Hanoverian entrance to our religious climate had as much \"\"imported spirituality\"\", from the Moravians obviously not being part of English dispositioneven if Wyclif and Jan Hus seemed to get along for the sole purpose of dissent, they were false friends and allied by circumstance of a mutual \"\"enemy\"\".  That purported enemy was Rome, the \"\"Whore of Babylon\"\" in some claims.  Our cultural traditions tend to be fiercely proud of the Greeks, Romans and Franksit is encapsuled in the machinery of our English language.

LOL.\\nThis guy just wouldnt listen to good sense. Theres no point in arguing with such a fool.\\n\\nAnyway, I expect you to post the Civility message you posted on my page, on his page, unless you are unfair.\\n\\nI am tempted to write a message to him saying \"\"Hey, stupid, how can people accept your stupid dumb utterly wrong criticisms and how can people not respond to ur dumb comments when u leave them on other\\'s user pages!\"\"\\n\\nBut, now, THAT would be uncivil, so I wont!!!\\n\\nAnyway, this is all quite silly and irrelevant and a waste of time (this message itself is too lengthy!!). I expect NOT to hear from u about this further on my user page though I will check if u posted a message to him, to confirm your impartiality either which way.\\n\\nAlso, I hope you remove your civility message from my user page, because i dont think its correct or impartial.\\n\\nAlso because I use my account now instead of the IP.\\n\\nBye bye.\\n\\nAnyway this is all quite extraneous and silly.

       "       '\"\\n\\nWhy Wikipedia Can\\'t Work\\nWikipedia claims (or is promoted by its users as) a replacement for the traditional encyclopedia. They frequently compare themselves to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, but in reality Wikipedia is not an adequate substitute, let alone a replacement. What\\'s more, because of fundamental problems in Wikipedia\\'s philosophy, design, and operation, it would appear impossible for Wikipedia to ever become such a substitute. \\n\\nThere are many problems with Wikipedia, some more important than others. I\\'ll discuss only two that have bitten me in the past. \\n\\nThe Ignorant Edit-Bully\\nMany people have noted this phenomenon, though I\\'ve never seen a good name for it before. In a nutshell, the problem is that a person knowledgable in a given field (but not a regular Wikipedia contributor) notices an obvious error in a page devoted to a topic in that field. They want to be a good citizen, so they edit the page and correct the error. However, within minutes, their correction has been reverted, restoring the error, and if they\\'re particularly unlucky, they may receive a note from the person that reverts their change, accusing them of \"\"page vandalism\"\". \\n\\nIt seems that there are a large number of Wikipedia devotees or zealots who have little more to do than hang around the Wikipedia site, watching for edits to pages that they\\'ve contributed to. Any change to \"\"their\"\" page is taken as a personal insult and instantly reverted, regardless of its merit. What\\'s worse is that the types of people who do this simply do not have the knowledge or intellectual tools to recognize the merit of the contribution. They would appear to typically be young people, perhaps in their first couple of years of college. They have the headstrong ignorance of the young adult, coupled with an insecurity complex that makes them unable to accept that others might have something to contribute that they themselves lack. In \"\"real life\"\" they would be harmless, as they wouldn\\'t be able to stand up to others in a confrontation, but the anonymity and isolation of the internet give them the confidence to become overly assertive. \\n\\nSo an expert makes a contribution, sees it discarded by someone who obviously has no qualifications to judge it and all the time in the world to get their own way, and the expert simply leaves, never to contribute to Wikipedia again. The quality of many of Wikipedia\\'s articles clearly shows this phenomenon; reading through the edit history of many pages shows it in action, graphically. \\n\\nNo Editors Means No Sense of the Valuable\\nWikipedia prides itself on not relying on professional editors, which they claim makes Wikipedia more egalitarian. However, egalitarianism is not necessarily a desirable quality in a reference work, as the philosophy of everyones contributions being equally valuable is simply untrue in the real world. As Theodore Sturgeon noted, \"\"ninety percent of everything is [crap]\"\". \\n\\nThis leads to the problem of many of the Wikipedia articles having been created or primarily edited by the \"\"edit bullies\"\" described above: \\n\\nThey do not necessarily have a broad knowledge of any of the topics they write about. \\nThey are generally not well-read or broadly-educated, having little context for the particular areas they have studied in any depth. \\nThey tend to have concentrated their reading on various things of personal interest to them, so they have no sense of proportion or of what is truly significant to the world, versus the trivia that was important to them as teenagers and such \\nThis results in the Wikipedia in general having laughably large holes in the areas it covers, while having an even more ridiculous amount of spurious detail on subjects that it has no need to cover. My current favourite example: \\n\\nMany Wikipedia articles about important historical figures are little more than caricatures, if they have sufficient details to even be called that. Many other important figures are simply not mentioned in Wikipedia at all. A number of months ago, I looked for information on an important North American manufacturing industry figure from the 1980s; he could be considered the most important business person of the decade. I was somewhat shocked to see that there was no article about him at all. Note that I am not identifying him by name; this is because Wikipedia tends to react quickly to correct specific faults only when those particular faults are widely publicized, in order to render that particular critique null. \\n\\nSo, being a good naive contributor, I created the article. I noted who he was, why he was famous, a few of his most important accomplishments, and I properly notated the article as being a people-related article stub, hoping others would help flesh it out. A few weeks later, I checked back, only to find that the article had been c',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n\\n\\nDavid Ernest Duke (born July 1, 1950) is a former Louisiana State Representative and former leader of the Ku Klux Klan.\\n\\nHe has made a number of unsuccessful political bids for higher office, including run for the Louisiana State House, Louisiana State Senate, United States Senate, United States House, governor of Louisiana and twice for president of the United States. In 2002 he pled guilty to tax evasion and fraud charges. He is a long-time New Orleans resident and the proud father of Erika and Kristin Duke. \\n\\n==Youth & Early Adulthood, the Klan and first campaigns==\\n\\nDavid Duke was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma to David H. & Maxine Duke. As a Shell Oil engineer his fathers frequently moved his wife, David, and his sister Dotti to numerious locations around the world. The Duke\\'s spent a short period of living in the Netherlands before they settled in Louisiana. Young David became interested in the white nationalist movement at an early age and joined the Klan in 1967. Duke went on to study at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge and in 1970, he formed a caucasian campus-group known as the White Youth Alliance. That same year, he made himself known even more by demonstrating in swastika regalia to protest William Kunstler\\'s appearance at Tulane University, LA. He was involved in the campus ROTC, until he was kicked out due to his radical beliefs. In 1971, he went to Laos to teach English to Laotian military officers and serve on cargo flights for Air America over the course of ten weeks.\\n\\nDuke returned to LSU, graduating in 1974. He became notorious on campus for wearing a Nazi uniform, Ku Klux Klan apparel, and swastika paraphernalia while picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of the birth of Adolf Hitler. The year of his graduation, he was elected Grand Wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. He attracted attention for trying to modernize the Klan and turn it into a modern nationalist political force. For example, he changed the title of \\'Grand Wizard\\' to \\'National Director\\' and sported a conservative suit as opposed to the traditional white robe. \\n\\nIn 1976, Duke sought a seat in the Louisiana State Senate as a Democrat. In 1978, he left the Klan and two years later formed the National Association for the Advancement of White People (NAAWP). In 1987, he conducted a direct-mail appeal using the identity and mailing-list of the Forsyth County Defense League, in Georgia, without permission, which League officials described as a fund-raising \"\"scam\"\" (detailed in The Rise of David Duke by Tyler Bridges). In 1988, he ran in the Democratic Party primary for President of the United States. After a dismal showing in the Democratic primaries, he appeared on many state ballots as the nominee of the Populist Party and received  approximately 25,000 votes in the 1988 general election.\\n\\nUsing the pseudonym Dorothy Vanderbilt, Dr. Duke published a self-help book for women titled Finders-Keepers in 1976. The publication gives advice to women regarding vaginal exercises, fellatio, anal sex, and anilingus .  The manual is no longer in print and hard to find, however “The Picayune”, a local Mississippi newspaper, managed to find a copy and trace the trail of it’s proceeds to the original  author via the publisher.\\n\\nIn the 1980s, he was heavily involved in gambling and stock market investments, which were covered by the Times-Picayune, as well as by others. Columbia Journalism Review, THE PICAYUNE CATCHES UP WITH DAVID DUKE Attitudes of Mississippi college students toward David Duke before and after seeing the film \\'Who Is David Duke?\\' The Nation, Republicanizing the Race Card\\n\\nIn the latter years of the 1980s, Duke sought to revamp his appearance by undergoing plastic surgery, and also shaved off his moustache following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives.\\n\\nIn 1984 David Duke and wife Chloe Hardin were divorced. Hardin then moved to West Palm Beach, Florida to be closer to her family. There she became involved with Duke’s childhood friend, Don Black, whom she married several years later. [http://www',\n",

       "       '\" 2006 (UTC)\\n\\n==Ideas for improving the article==\\nGreat article. I took the liberty of replacing ˡ (U+02E1 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL L) in the article with ˈ (U+02C8 MODIFIER LETTER VERTICAL LINE) where it is used to indicate a stressed syllable. The former character is incorrect since although it appears as a vertical line in sans-serif fonts, it actually appears like a superscript lowercase l or a superscript 1 in serif fonts like Charis SIL and Doulos SIL. I only noticed this because I have a CSS hack that applies to all uses of the IPA template and forces a different font for them. I’m taking phonology at U. Hawaii at Mānoa so I’ll be sure to add anything interesting about Hawaiian that comes up. —  \\n\\n:Oh crap! Didn\\'t even catch that.  I hope I haven\\'t done it elsewhere.  \\n\\n::Well, like I said, I only noticed it because I have a CSS hack in place. I only wish that the rest of the world had the SIL IPA fonts installed... —  \\n\\n:::Again, glad you like the article. The replacement symbol you used looked alright to me, but so did the original symbol. It\\'s a stretch to claim \"\"[t]he former character is incorrect\"\" on the basis of its appearance in fonts that 99.99% of users do not have. Most people have never heard of the Summer Institute for Linguistics. The character that I used to mark syllable stress is the one that Wikipedia presents for use in the IPA list of symbols below the edit box. So if you feel you have a \"\"better\"\" symbol, then you should contact Wikipedians who are in a position to consider implementing your suggestion(s). You might try Brion Vibber. If you learn something new about Hawaiian phonology at UH, do let us know. But remember, Wikipedia does not want anything that is not already published. So if it\\'s \"\"new\"\", it might be unpublished, and therefore undesirable under Wikipedia policy.   \\n\\n::::The font used to display the characters is unimportant. Their character encodings are specific. On the basis of the two Unicode names, I argue that U+02E1 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL L is inappropriate as the stress marker in IPA. Checking the appropriate Unicode chart on their website I find that U+02C8 MODIFIER LETTER VERTICAL LINE is listed under the section “Miscellaneous phonetic modifiers” with the comment “primary stress, downstep; precedes letter or syllable modified”. On the other hand, U+02E1 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL L is given in the section “Additions based on 1989 IPA” just below U+02E0 MODIFIER LETTER SMALL GAMMA which has the comment “these modifier letters are occasionally used in transcription of affricates”. So it’s fairly clear that the Unicode standard makes a distinction between their intended purposes. I note that in the bottom of the edit box the two are given in sequence, with U+02C8 immediately following U+02E1. It’s easily possible to press the first of the two accidentally. I will bring this up at m:Help talk:Special characters and ask someone to reorder them for clarity. —  \\n\\n:::::Your explanation and argument sounds good. I don\\'t know the layout of the \"\"insert box\"\" characters on other users\\' screens. When I edit, the IPA characters are displayed in two lines. The first line ends with tiny lowercase superscripts: h, w, a j-like character, gamma, \"\"lefty\"\" glottal, n. The second line begins with the character I used for stress mark, followed by other stress marks, length mark, something too obscure to make out, a mid-height black square (apparently used to mark the end of a series of related symbols), and then the line ends with the double-curly-bracketed IPA. Based on your explanation, it appears that the first line of IPA characters is broken in a way that misled me into thinking that the last member of the series of superscripts is the first member of a series of stress marks. Bad line break. And there is no mid-height black square, nor significant white space, separating the superscript series from the stress mark series. Not seeing that previously, I used the first mark because it looks the same as the second, but darker. Of course, it also happened because a tiny superscripted sans-serif L looks nearly identical to a tiny superscripted vertical line.\\n\\n:::::If you have the motivation, maybe you can suggest more than just reordering in your communication with the Special Characters people. The addition of a separation character between the series of superscripts and the series of stress marks will help. Here\\'s my best suggestion to offer on this matter - persuade the Special Characters folks to implement appropriate new text for the ho',\n",

More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. \\n\\nCompass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 \\n\\n\\n\\nA group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. \\n\\n“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” \\n\\nAbou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. \\n\\nIn an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. \\n\\nBishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” \\n\\nIn an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. \\n\\nIn articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. \\n\\n“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” \\n\\nAs a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” \\n\\nWorship Rights \\n\\n\\nIn his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. \\n\\nThe bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. \\n\\n“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” \\n\\nThe bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajaltoun had the right to change their religious affiliation. \\n\\nAbou-Mekhael told Compass today that the church remains officially sealed, and that he is in the process of filing a case against the attackers. He also said that his congregation of approximately 80 people is ready to open a second case if they are denied their constitutional right to worship at the site. \\n\\n“Even if we get permission to remove the red wax, there are still threats from the mayor and from the bishop that if we go to worship they will attack again,” the pastor told Compass. “By the constitution of Lebanon, we have the freedom to worship there. But they say, ‘Okay, go try to practice your rights, but we will stop you.’” \\n\\nIn light of Lebanon’s deeply entrenched ethnic and religious',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n== South Korea started the war ==\\n\\nThe events now taking place in Korea broke out on June 25 as the result of a provocative attack by the troops of the South Korean authorities on the frontier areas of the Korean People\\'s Democratic Republic. This attack was the outcome of a premeditated plan.\\n\\nFrom time to time Syngman Rhee himself and other representatives of the South Korean authorities had blurted out the fact that the South Korean Syngman Rhee clique had such a plan.\\n\\nAs long ago as October 7, 1949, Syngman Rhee, boasting of success in training his army, stated outright, in an interview given to an American United Press correspondent, that the South Korean Army could capture Pyongyang in the course of three days.\\n\\nOn October 31, 1949, Sin Sen Mo, Defence Minister of the Syngman Rhee Government, also told newspaper correspondents that the South Korean troops were strong enough to act and take Pyongyang within a few days. Only one week before the provocative attack of the South Korean troops on the frontier areas of the Korean People\\'s Democratic Republic, Syngman Rhee said, in a speech on June 19 in the so-called \"\"National Assembly\"\" where Mr. Dulles, adviser to the U.S. State Department, was present: \"\"If we cannot protect democracy in the cold war, we shall win in a hot war.\"\"\\n\\nIt is not difficult to understand that representatives of the South Korean authorities could only make such statements because they felt that they bad American support behind them. One month before the present developments in Korea, on May 19, 1950, Mr. Johnson, chief American administrator of aid to Korea, told the American Congress House of Representatives\\' Appropriations Committee that 100,000 officers and men of the South Korean Army, equipped with American weapons and trained by the American Military Mission, bad completed their preparations and could begin war at any time.\\n\\nIt is known that only a few days before the Korean events, the United States Defence Secretary, Mr. Johnson, the Chief of the General Staff of the United States Armed Forces, General Bradley, and the State Department adviser, Mr. Dulles, arrived in Japan and had special conferences with General MacArthur, and that afterwards Mr. Dulles visited South Korea and went to frontier areas on the 38th Parallel.\\n\\nOnly one week before the events-on June 19-Mr. Dulles, adviser to the State Department, declared in the above-mentioned \"\"National Assembly\"\" of South Korea that the United States was ready to give all necessary moral and material support to South Korea which was fighting against Communism.\\n\\nThese facts speak for themselves and need no comment. . . .\\n\\nThe United States Government tries to justify armed intervention against Korea by alleging that it was undertaken on the authorisation of the Security Council. The falsity of such an allegation strikes the eye.\\n\\nWhat really happened? It is known that the United States Government had started armed intervention in Korea before the Security Council was summoned to meet on June 27, without taking into consideration what decision the Security Council might take. Thus the United States Government confronted the United Nations Organisation with a fait accompli, with a violation of peace.\\n\\nThe Security Council merely rubber-stamped and back-dated the resolution proposed by the United States Government, approving the aggressive actions which this Government had undertaken. . . .\\n\\nThe illegal resolution of June 27, adopted by the Security Council under pressure from the United States Government, shows that the Security Council is acting, not as a body which is charged with the main responsibility for the maintenance of peace, but as a tool utilised by the ruling circles of the United States for unleashing war. This resolution of the Security Council constitutes a hostile act against peace.\\n\\nIf the Security Council valued the cause of peace, it should have attempted to reconcile the fighting sides in Korea before it adopted such a scandalous resolution. Only the Security Council and the United Nations Secretary-General could have done this. However, they did not make such an attempt, evidently knowing that such peaceful action contradicts the aggressors\\' plans.\\n\\nhttp://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1950-gromyko-korea.html\"',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n===My overview===\\n\\n1. Intro: Euskadi ta Askatasuna is translated as Basque Homeland and Freedom, yet Euskadi (a neologism) is surely better translated as Basque Country, in the territorial and political sense of the term \"\"country\"\". The term homeland is kind of totally out of place, as happens in some other article. There\\'s no real equivalent for homeland in Basque or Spanish and sounds very strange. \\n\\n2. Aims: Mountolive seemed to insist in claiming (erroneously) that ETA\\'s principal aim is to create a socialist state. This is not real, has been discussed before and can be documented. The current status is ok.\\n\\n3. Secondary tactical targets: \\n*Drug traffickers (this has a \"\"citation needed\"\" mark). I can\\'t provide the citation but can say that in the early 80s it was the case. \\n*I would like a source for the Leitzaran highway, a more recent case, that I think is not so clear though. \\n*Possibly the complex struggle of Lemoiz nuclear plant needs its own article but well... there are no doubts that at some point ETA took it as their own circustantial fight and actually were decissive in stopping its construction. This may well justify a section of its own for this particular case but a separate article is maybe a better solution.\\n\\n4. Context: the entry is ok as for now, unless someone has a better idea. There was a minor dispute about wether Askatasuna (former GG.AA./AAT) should be defined as \"\"anti-repressive\"\" or just stated without any explanation. \\n\\n5. Social support is a little confuse and maybe POV. There\\'s much emphasis on Francoism, what is surely justified, but the division Navarre+Araba vs. Guipuscoa+Biscay is interpreted from the Francoist POV more or less. After all, whatever the support that fascists had in Navarre and Araba, they fell in that side because of where the coup triumphed. There were only three cities in all Spain where the coup was aborted: Madrid, Barcelona and St. Sebastian (plus partially Toledo and Oviedo), the rest just fell where they got in luck. In this sense sentences like Since some Basque nationalists had sided with the Republican government in the Spanish Civil War, Franco restricted virtually any public expressions of Basque culture... are very tendentious. Francoism attempted and partly suceeded in emphasizing the divisions between the provinces with such tactics as declaring Biscay and Guipuscoa \"\"traitor provinces\"\" but not Madrid, Barcelona, Santander or Murcia, that were also in the Republican side. \\n\\nThe last paragraph of this section is also confuse. It\\'s not clear what erosion may have suffered \"\"MLNV\"\" (acronym is not clear for the English reader) in recent years. Sources are needed but HB-EH-Batasuna-EHAK support has oscilated between 18% and 12% (in all Southern Basque Country, Navarre included, where this sector is the largest nationalist one), with ups and downs, and is difficult to count in some elections because of the ban on Batasuna and anything of the like. \\n\\nThe claims on Iparralde are rather false. More than 10% voted nationalist (mostly AB) in latest elections. But regionalism (claim for a separate Basque departement, greater presence of Basque language in administration, economic institutions, etc.) is widespread, being promised by politicians of all parties in each election and rejected by Paris right after them.\\n\\n6.

       "       \", 18 January 2007 (UTC)\\n\\nOh you dont say!! I think you will find it very clear from everything I have contributed towards on wikipedia that concerns this subject, that I am the one who has clarrified that it was a Muslim-Christian conflict. And no, once again, you are very biased, and lack alot of knowledge about your own faith. Yes, there were Europeans, the 'west', what were they then,?? Africans, Asians?? that part of the world is called Europe. The crusaders came from all over Europe, so get that right for starters. And let me tell you this, these muslims who were 'invading' Byazantinian lands, were the people of the middle east who were conquered by the byzantinians. These 'pleaing' byzantinians, along with the ROMAN catholics were all trinitarian christians, and remenat of the pagan Roman Religeon (due to the inevitable spread of true jesuit unitarian christianity, the roman empire found itself in a critical position and had to adopt the christian faith and embed it in their previous pagan beliefs, hence the celebration of sunday- rather than the jesuit saturday- sunday was tthe holy day for pagan romans. The cross, a pagan roman sign-never adopted by jesus. the fish, a pagan Egyptian sign adopted by the romans, the trinity, the whole tihing about the vatican in rome etc etc.)were massacring the indigenous people of the levant which they occupied, who were mostly unitarian sects of christianity, and the followers of the more accurate versions of the gospel (which weree written fairly shortly after Jesus's ascent-not the centuries old, heavily altered versions you follow). These Unitarians had prophecies in their gospels of  the coming of a final prophet, and the signs and times pointed to Mohammad and most of them adopted Islam, because they knew Mohammad was their prophet, as prophesized by Jesus. The byzantinians (romans) were killing them and there familys, and they were deemed by the church at the councils of nicea as heretics, so the mass population who were invaded by romans, were indeed monotheistic Unitarians. The Muslims liberated these people of the land from the tyrant byzantinians. Even under Islamic rule, the roman minority citizens were left to live in peace amongst the Muslims, and a testimony to this is the fact that these same roman minorities still live on in  the middle east.\\nJerusalem was sacked ny the romans, and its people liberated by the Muslims.\\nAnd were YOU aware that the inquisition (which by the way you put it acted independantly from the church-stop lying, the church was the ultimate ruler as everyone knows, which murdered science and scientists and had complete control over everyone-as seen by the call to the crusades. You are an apologetic, not muslims, everything was done in the name of the church, why, even colonialists came into countries and plundered them with priests accompanying them)You claim it has nothing to do with the church-and I never said that the inquisition was called for by the pope, where did you get that rubbish from?? dont put words in my mouth-however, up until the 18th /19th century, the bodies and skeletons of muslims and 'heretics' killed by the inquisition were still hangig from the ceilings of churches!! The church is the one who deems people as heretics, and is the one who approved of the killings full stop. Please dont try to correct me before you yourself go and do some academic unbiased research like I did, most of my sources were non muslim sources that were ballanced. (obviously unlike you)\\nAnd about the pope issuing edicts against the killing of muslims or Jews, well what do you mean THE pope, dont you mean, A pope (there were many you know). And this is about the inquisittion and not the pope, perhaps a pope at a different time to the inquisition said that they (logically) shouldnt kill other people like barbarians, Im not doubting, you, but it would be helpful if you could mention the name. Again, dont go off the topic, this was about hte inquisition.\\nAnd yes, I bloomin love life under Islam, as a woman I feel liberated and free, and as an environmentallist and a concerned person for childrens rights i feel supported, and as a lover of logic and equality I feel I found the truth (there was a debate in the church at one point and they were discussing whether or not women were humans!!!!) If it wasnt for Islam the motor wouldnt have been invented (the crank shaft) tall buildings (dur to architectural techniques) education including higher education for all sexes classes and colours, merit was becasue of knowledge, and not wealth, and there is so much more that is owed to them, basically, we would have stil been living in huts right now if it wasnt for them, and dont forget that the romans forcibly converted us to roman 'christianity' when they invaded us. I love Islam, and YOU are showing everybody how ignorant YOU are by exposing your complete lack of knowledge (and trying to stray off the arguame\",\n",
       "       '\"I am removing the following section for two reasons:\\n\\n\"\"Some anthropologists and sociologists are critical of the method because it measures personality traits on a basis of its synonymous adjectives in the English language, thus overlooking possible cultural construction of language. That English alone was used in factor analysis also arguably demonstrates an example of ethnocentrism. Furthermore, sociologists are critical that the theory only reinforces stereotypes and ignores social factors that might have lead to traits being present in certain groups of individuals. For instance, while women have a demonstrated tendency towards agreeableness, this is likely true of most subordinated individuals. Tying this trait to women at a psychological level then only reasserts inequalities by implying that differences exist as a matter of human nature rather than as a result of the social construction of gender.\"\"\\n\\n\\n1. The information given there is incorrect. I\\'ve checked the scientific research to be sure, and English alone was *not* used in factor analysis, and the existence and nature of the Big Five factors has been validated in multiple continents. Here\\'s an excerpt from McCrae & Hofstede\\'s fascinating paper, Personality and Culture Revisited: Linking Traits and Dimensions of Culture (2004):\\n\\n\\n\"\"Research in the English-speaking world using the NEO-PI-R established that individual differences in the factors are stable throughout most of the adult life span; that self-reports generally agree with observer ratings; and that the five factors, as well as the more specific traits that define them, are strongly heritable. In the 1990s, researchers around the world began to develop translations 2 of the instrument, making cross-cultural research possible. A series of studies showed that much the same factor structure was found in a wide variety of cultures (McCrae & Costa, 1997), that developmental trends in the mean levels of personality traits between adolescence and later\\nadulthood appeared to be universal (McCrae et al., 1999), and\\nthat similar gender differences were found among cultures (Costa,\\nTerracciano, & McCrae, 2001).\"\"\\n\\n\\nHere are the relevant citations from the above; if you can find them, I suggest taking a look:\\n\\nMcCrae, R. R., & Costa, P. T., Jr. (1997). Personality trait structure as a human universal. American Psychologist, 52, 509-516.\\n\\nMcCrae, R. R., Costa, P. T., Jr., Lima, M. P., Simões, A., Ostendorf, F., Angleitner, A., et al. (1999). Age differences in personality across the adult life span: Parallels in five cultures. Developmental Psychology, 35, 466-477.\\n\\nCosta, P. T., Jr., Terracciano, A., &McCrae;, R. R. (2001). Gender differences in personality traits across cultures: Robust and surprising findings. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 81, 322-331.\\n\\n\\nAs a further note in this regard, one group of subordinated individuals - prisoners - show personality profiles with low Agreeableness scores. Teenagers also show lower Agreeableness than adults. So I don\\'t think it\\'s \"\"likely true of most subordinated individuals\"\" that they have high Agreeableness. In point of fact, it appears that Extroversion actually has more to do with social dominance than Agreeableness does. (And men score higher in the Assertiveness sub-scale of Extroversion, incidentally, as given in the last study cited above.)\\n\\n\\n2. Beyond being incorrect, I don\\'t like the above statement because it demonstrates bias. The fact that psychometric research \"\"reinforces stereotypes\"\" does not show that the research is bad or wrong; instead, it supports the truth to these stereotypes. Whether women are Agreeable because of genetic or environmental reasons is irrelevant to the question of whether Agreeableness is a valid and universal psychomentric construct. And of course while sociologists and anthropologists may be unhappy about these research results, that doesn\\'t change the facts.\\n\\nHopefully this explanation is thorough enough to obviate the necessity of future arguments.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n:Clearly the point is biased in some direction; it is, after all, called criticism. However, it is appreciatable to rework claims rather than remove them entirely, as for example my move to redirect back the bias of your word \"\"discovered\"\", implying a factual truth of the matter, back to the more neutral term identified, and my return of your loaded attempt of beginning the criticism section with \"\"While the general consensus favoring a five-factor model is strong, there is still dissention.\"\"\\n\\n:And how was the Big Five originally constructed if not through factor analysis of personality traits from the English dictionary? That\\'s what I had read. If later attempts were made to see if othe',\n",

In the words of Robert Collins, \"\"The explanations [for the colonization of Africa] are nearly as unsatisfactory as they are numerous.  The misconceptions are as enduring as they are erroneous.  To scholar and student alike, the search for understanding this dynamic period, which resulted in European colonial rule in Africa and dramatically altered the future of a vast continent, is the Problem of the Partition of Africa.\"\"Robert O. Collins, Historical Problems of Imperial Africa, (Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1994), 7\\n\\nBy 1870, many European nations were interested in the African interior, and began moving up the rivers.  Generally, except for a few cases, foreign powers could not move beyond \"\"small coastal enclaves.\"\" Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 301  But from the years of 1880-1900, the European imperial powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many colonial nation states, and leaving only two independent nations: Liberia, an independent state partly settled by African Americans; and Orthodox Christian Ethiopia (known to Europeans as \"\"Abyssinia\"\"). Colonial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of World War II, when all colonial states gradually obtained formal independence.\\n\\nThe scramble came from the rising of a new world from old Europe.  Until this point, Britain had been the undisputed leader in the industrial realm.  They could produce more manufactured goods than any other country, and at the lowest price.  Britain promoted the idea of \"\"free trade\"\" in Africa, the idea that no European countries would interfere with one another while freely trading in Africa.  Britain had no worries until the 1860\\'s when \"\"France, Germany, and the United States had caught up with Britain in terms of industrial technology and manufacturing.\"\" Kevin Shillington, History of Africa: Revised Second Edition, (New York: Macmillian Publishers Limited, 2005), 301 \\n\\nAs a result of this industrialization of the world, there was a shortage of markets to sell to.  many European countries, as a result, looked to Africa as a potential client. Some believed when diamonds were discovered in 1869 they \"\"provided the incentive and capital for a large influx of Europeans.\"\"Robert O. Collins, Historical Problems of Imperial Africa, (Princeton: Markus Wiener Publishers, 1994), 7  The creation of the Suez Canal \"\"not only made the East African coast more accessible but also became the great pivot in British imperial strategy.\"\"ibid., 7 Above all else, we must look at this imperial world pragmatically and not ideologically. Until this point, \"\"military and political relations between Africans and Europeans concludes that Africans controlled the nature of their interactions with Europe.  Europeans did not possess the military power to force Africans in any type of trade in which their leaders did not wish to engage.\"\" John Thornton, Africa and Africans in the making of the Atlantic World, 1400-1800, second edition (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), 7\\n\\nBut a new world, as noted above, had begun.  Because of new competition in the trading industries of Europe and the Americas, Britain now had rivals for trade in Africa.  Even smaller countries sometimes wanted to get involved looking for quick cash and to find ways to sustain their countries.

       "       '\" call \"\"current\"\" discussion; that is, our discussion of the big changes you started here just about 30 days ago.  It will be hard to anyone coming to the discussion at this point to know much of what we\\'re talking about with this much removed.  \\n\\n::I know, but then not much was being removed.  But I\\'ve put back October.\\n\\n== Cultural depictions of Johannes Gutenberg ==\\n\\nI\\'ve started an approach that may apply to Wikipedia\\'s Core Biography articles: creating a branching list page based on in popular culture information.  I started that last year while I raised Joan of Arc to featured article when I created Cultural depictions of Joan of Arc, which has become a featured list.  Recently I also created Cultural depictions of Alexander the Great out of material that had been deleted from the biography article.  Since cultural references sometimes get deleted without discussion, I\\'d like to suggest this approach as a model for the editors here.  Regards, \\'\\'\\' \\n\\n==Clean-up and changes by Mukerjee Oct 18==\\n\\nA number of changes were made and the article was considerably cleaned up on\\nOct 18:\\n\\n* The claims of printing in Korea and China, largely unreferenced were referenced with extensive quotations\\n* The Biography section which was only a paragraph with other fragments scattered elsewhere was cleaned up (but still needs work). \\n* The contributions of Gutenberg as the father of the printing press and a leading catalyst of the Renaissance have been under challenge from a number of quarters, this was presented with documentation\\n* The possibility that East-West traffic over the two preceding centuries of the Mongol Empire may have led to some knowledge in Europe of movable type  was introduced \\n* A number of sentences and structures (such as the unwieldy initial paragraphs) were copyedited ruthlessly, merged with other fragments, and cleaned up. \\n\\nUser Dicklyon reverts with the comment: too much of a change to do without discussion. \\nThis is not a criteria in Wikipedia, where ruthless editing is consistently\\nencouraged. \\n\\nPlease justify in what way these changes are inappropriate and merge them by\\nputting in extensive work instead of just a revert. \\n\\nI am reverting back to the new version which certainly reads better, and has \\nfar better referencing and citations than the present version.  Please give\\nyour reasons here; please do not blindly revert; edit\\'\\'\\' the text \\nto merge the elements you don\\'t agree with.   It does not make sense to keep\\nthe older inferior version that people are working with still.   \\n\\n:Such an extensive edit that throws out the stable work of many editors over many months, with no chance for incremental review and collaboration, is just too disruptive and disrespectful, in my opinion.  But I\\'ll let someone else decide now whether to revert you again.  I recommend a revert, followed by you re-integrating changes piece by piece, with time between for reactions and negotiations.  \\n\\n:p.s. We don\\'t need weasle words in the lead.  If it is verfiably true that \"\"Even within Europe, there are those who claim that Laurens Janszoon Coster of Holland may have used movable types earlier,\"\" then you have to say WHO makes such a claim, and give a verifiable reference for it.  The things I have read about Coster did NOT say that anyone actually claims or believes that, only that it was a local legend for a while.  \\n\\n::I understand your angst at having many microscopic changes gone.  But the so-called \"\"stable\"\" version read rather poorly, and at least the English and the flow is a lot cleaner.  There were repeated references (e.g. two consecutive parags referred to his family in Biog; the A&E; award had two references, etc), there were poor constructs,\\nand of course, the referencing was admittedly poor.  So please try to look at the whole picture.  Wikipedia says it right up front - edit the page only if you don\\'t mind others \"\"ruthlessly\"\" editing your text. \\nAs for the weasel word issue, this is what the current version reads (pls see the Biography section) - these were edits that were made before your comment here:\\n\\n:::His business partner was Johann Fust who was more of a banker than a printer, but a 1568 history by Hadrianus Junius of Holland claims that the basic idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from Laurens Janszoon Coster via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster around 1940 and may have brought some of his equipment to Mainz',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n:::Regarding your edits to Medieval II: Total War: While your interest and contribution is most certainly appreciated, I removed the section because it overlapped with information throughout the rest of the article. I originally tried to edit it, trimming the parts that were redundant, but the remainder wasn\\'t worth keeping in a section of its own. If you don\\'t mind, I\\'ll include the section that you added in italics and address each part as it appears.  \\n\\n== Fighting Campaign Battles ==  \\t \\nDuring the campaign the player has the option of forming armies to defend their borders, wage war and destroy rebel armies that appear occasionaly. \\n\\nThis is already covered under the second paragraph of the Gameplay section, specifically: \"\"The campaign allows the player to assume control of a faction of the time period, and build a civilization, economy and military in order to conquer other factions. Gameplay consists of controlling the faction\\'s military, economic, and social systems via a large campaign map. During the player\\'s turn, armies, fleets, and agents can be moved on the map. When an army engages another army, the player can choose to fight the battle personally, in the battle mode, or automatically calculate the outcome.\"\"\\n\\nArmies are formed from \\'Units\\' normally consisted of 20-30 men for artillery, 30-40 men for cavalry and 60-70 men for infantry or archers. In adition to this a general can also recruit mercenaries for a price if need be. An army can consist of up to twenty units, or as little as one, and will move according to the units it contains. This means that an army consisting entirely of cavalry can cover a lot of ground in one turn, but would be able to cover a much shorter distance were the army to have any artillery or infantry units. \\n\\nI feel that this falls under http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:NOT#Wikipedia_is_not_an_indiscriminate_collection_of_information specifically section 4, Instruction Manuals. The specific number of people in a unit isn\\'t significant except in the context of the game, nor are unit speed, the ability to recruit mercenaries and army size limits (since they are artificial limits established by the game designers.)\\n\\nA general can be selected from amongst your family to lead the army, and he will benefit or hinder the army based on his personal traits, a General who starts fighting when he is young is more likely to develop a keen skill for combat that one who has spent most of his life governing a city. The risk is that should the army be beaten then the General may die, and even during a battle that is going in your favour your general can still get cut off, surrounded by the enemy or hit by a stray arrow. Losing a general can bring an end to a generation if he were the only son without an heir, which can affect your whole family tree for generations. An army without a general is lead by a captain, who will fight alongside whichever unit you select as the first unit in your army. A captain who performs well in battle may be promoted to General, and be adopted into your family. These generals are generally better suited to combat rather than Govenment roles.\\n\\nGenerals are already covered under Agents and Characters: \"\"In addition to their agents, each faction is ruled by a family, the male members of which act as generals in battle. Each general has a number of attributes which determine how well he governs a settlement and how well he leads an army in battle. A general\\'s actions can affect his attributes- for example, a general who routinely kills prisoners of war may see his \"\"dread\"\" increase, making him frightening to foes; a general who prefers to release prisoners may instead increase his \"\"chivalry\"\", which makes his own troops braver.\"\"\\n\\nWhen two armies meet they can engage in combat, which can be either automatically resolved by the computer or fought by the the player.\\n\\nAlready covered at the end of the second paragraph of Gameplay: \"\"When an army engages another army, the player can choose to fight the battle personally, in the battle mode, or automatically calculate the outcome.\"\"\\n\\n\\'\\'Armies can meet in several ways: two armies meet on an area of open ground face to face and resolve their differences, an army can wait in a wooded area and surprise a passing enemy army, an army can lay seige to a town or castle and fight the garrison for control. Training and forming a working army is an expensive and lengthly process, and traveling to fight the enemy can take even longer, so the aim of every Battle during the campaign is to kill or capture as many of the enemy as possible, while minimizing the loss to your own army, thus allowing you to carry on fighting for longer with the same army. This means knowing exactly when and where to strike',\n",

       "       '\"the developer is a disputed fact that invites a claim by the opposing camp.  I have therefore changed \"\"developer\"\" to \"\"eponym\"\", since there is at least no apparent dispute about the source of the automobile\\'s name.  This maintains the familial link with the vehicle without getting into the substantive dispute at the wrong place.  \\n18:09, 2003 Oct 28 (UTC)\\n\\nThanks, that may at least defuse things a little.  \\n\\nMy personal thought is that if this is to get any mention on Ferdinand or Ferry Porsche\\'s page the text should relate to them directly, rather than being the same cut and paste sentence.  \\n\\nMentioning that Ferdinand Porsche gets most of the popular credit for a lot of things that were actually as much or more a product of his employees, and pointing out that this is common practice in the design industry  the boss gets the credit  would be a bit more NPOV.  Mentioning Komenda as one of those who gets overlooked in favor of the boss would be OK for me too.\\n\\n \\n\\n:Before I get any further on this subject, I would like clarificaton about the relative roles of Ferdinand and Ferry in this issue.  I would like to see the fact of Ferdinand\\'s univolvement nailed down before I approach the matter of Ferry, or before I try to address the simple revert battle now going on here.\\n\\n:The bulk of the story clearly belongs on the Komenda page.  A one-sentence reference on the Ferry page saying that Ferry\\'s claim is disputed is appropriate, and it should then refer those who want more on the story to the Komenda page.  01:57, 2003 Oct 29 (UTC)\\n\\n::This is the situation that I think is the truth, from my reading.  When Ferdinand Porsche set up an independent engineering consultancy in Germany (in the 30s?) although he was the company founder and head engineer he employed a number of other engineers - the jobs were too big for just one man.  Among the men he employed was Erwin Komenda, who had previously worked for Daimler-Benz and before that Steyr.  Komenda was an expert in auto body construction and the engineering of pressed sheet metal bodywork, that I can determine.  \\n\\n::Ferdinand Porsche\\'s field of expertise seems to have been the mechanical aspects of vehicles, engines and the like, and the overall team direction.  Komenda worked on the bodywork of the KDF-wagen (later to become the Beetle) among others.  Komenda definitely worked on translating ideas for the basic shape into sheet metal and the detail design of the bodywork.  Many of the plans and patent applications from this period are signed by Komenda and applied for with his name on them.  Whether his were the first pencil sketches that were turned into auto bodies I am less sure.  It\\'s certainly possible that they were, though I am sure others in the team including Ferdinand Porsche had a lot of input.\\n\\n\\nJUST A THOUGHT:\\n\\nShouldn\\'t this page consider division into chapters:\\n\\n(i.e.)\\nEarly Life\\nWWI\\nWWII\\n\\nPorche is a fascinating man with a career so linked with the World Wars  but that almost seems lost and in this bio. His involvement in WWII with the Nazis in both the Racing circuit and in the War effort really shaped his life and that that of the world. He represents a true place in history - so perhaps a chapter insersion could better work here.  Just a suggestion.\\nDH - 10/16/05\\n::Postwar, Porsche\\'s son Ferry and the other engineers who had worked for Ferdinand during the war came together (initially in Austria) to design cars.  Ferdinand was imprisoned until 1949 for war crimes relating to the use of slave labor in projects he worked on.\\n\\n::Between them, a car was designed that became the Porsche 356.  Komenda played a big part in this.  It would be incorrect to say that he was the designer, per se, because he only worked on the bodywork.  However, its construction was his, and probably much of its styling.  He also worked in a similar capacity for later Porsche cars.\\n\\n::What I think needs to be done is to write more about Ferdinand\\'s consultancy and Ferry\\'s postwar sports car company so Komenda can be placed in his proper context.  WHen part of a larger article it will seem less \\'heavy\\'.\\n\\n==Protected==\\n\\nIn this case, it\\'s rather difficult to revert to a pre-edit-war version. Since there\\'s no getting around the fact that I agree with Wik that the link should not be included, I have protected the page on a version including the link, to avoid the perception of bias. \\n\\nI\\'ve seen both Wik and Lir resort to edit wars (not infrequently with each other), and there\\'s something you both need to understand: \\'\\'\\'edit wars are  ',\n",

If you also haven\\'t noticed, many other valuable editors who used to contribute regularly just, say, a year ago, are now long gone. I suppose I was left the only one to hold the fort. It\\'s now clear, however, that you simply don\\'t appreciate what\\'s happening here, and no matter how hard I try, you never will.\\n\\n::I know this will be futile, but I\\'ll explain how I see things one last time: The Humanities RefDesk used to be a wonderful place to learn. OPs would ask questions, and a decent variety of intellectuals would put in their admittedly POV two-cents, with the result of providing the OP with a variety of differing POV answers, which is basically the closest one can get to an NPOV answer to any \"\"humanities\"\" related topic. This was the Humanities RefDesk I fell in love with.\\n\\n::Now, however, it\\'s pretty much dominated by one supposed omniscient Cambridge Phd. One who verbally abuses other editors in the cruelest and most sadistic of manners due to the \"\"folly\"\" she percieves in their contributions (while the admins conveniently turn a blind eye). One who is incapable of those all-too-human facets known as humilty and fallability. This editor proceeds upon handing down, as if from above, her more-often-than-not flawed, revisionist, biased, and downright incorrect responses (and from my own ethnic POV, extremely offensive and insulting to the memory of my family) to historical questions. When these responses are succesfully challenged, she is incapable of responding in a civil manner (not just to me) and lowering herself to \"\"stand corrected\"\".\\n\\n::These, to me, are not the makings of a RefDesk editor, nor a proper historian. \\n\\n::But once again, you\\'re right. Enough is enough. I\\'ve spent far too much time and effort on this. If you\\'d indeed prefer the Humanities RefDesk to degenerate into a ClioBlog, then that last obstacle you\\'ve been facing, little old Loomis51, has given up. I fought the good fight, and I\\'m damned proud of it. This, to me, is truly a sad day for Wikipedia.\\n\\n::This is no grand exit, no demand to be blocked, nothing melodramatic like that. I still love Wikipedia and its articles. Unfortunately that once great Humanities RefDesk that I couldn\\'t wait to come to visit upon returning home from work, in order to learn new things, and (hopefully) return the favour by sharing whatever I know with others, is no longer. \\n\\n::I\\'m not really sure what all those nonsensical \"\"conditions\"\" you noted above were, nor did I pay much attention to them. Whether my words above are some sort of \"\"breach\"\" of those conditions, I have no idea, nor do I care. \\n\\n::I just can\\'t help but find it funny that you\\'ve extended your jurisdiction to Wikiversity. What\\'s next? If you can somehow hack into my Yahoo account, will my emails now be scrutinized for any anti-Clio content? How about MSN? Is it ok if I call Stu up on the phone and speak \"\"inappropriately\"\" of her? lol (Not that either of us really cares about all this bullshit to actually talk on the phone about it, we have lives, you know! We\\'ve never even spoken on the phone, and interestingly, I know rather little about him except that he\\'s apparently from Detroit and that we disagree on pretty much every issue except for the fact that Clio\\'s a fraud! I\\'m actually rather curious. I\\'ve often wondered if Stu is perhaps some obese Asian guy, some skinny Black guy, some white senior citizen, or whatever!) \\n\\nIf you want to block me, then block me. If you don\\'t, then don\\'t. It\\'s all so obviously arbitrary that I really don\\'t give a shit at this point what you do. All you should know is that I\\'m just pretty much fed up with the whole RefDesk farce, and I don\\'t really see myself engaging in it in any way any time soon. I have absolutely no intention of any further \"\"Doctor Anastasia\"\" bashing, as like I said, it\\'s futile. If you don\\'t believe me, then block me. If not, then don\\'t. Do as you please.\\n\\n::Let me just mark this day, June 4th, 2007. Let\\'s just see how the Humanities RefDesk looks in say, six months from now: December 4th, 2007. Will all be as is?

Vote:  Do not shorten for the sake of shortening. \\n\\n:I think the \"\"Very Long\"\" tag may date back to before when material was split off into subarticles.  The article is still kind of long even after that, but manageable I think.  However imagine what will happen if she gets elected President!  All that has come before will be dwarfed by the new material to come. \\n\\n:Regarding the \"\"CV section\"\" that you () have been trying to get in, it doesn\\'t do much good buried late in the article.  If we are going to add something like that, it should go into the infobox at the start of the article.  Then it could have a standard, prominent presentation for all politicians.  But you\\'d have to campaign with the infobox maintainers to get this accepted.    \\n\\n:I was orginally very confused about her background because it takes work to figure out when she was practicing law and if it overlapped with being First Lady.  A short list of jobs is useful.  What\\'s there to hide.  She was never in prison.  She worked for a prestigous law firm. \\n\\n::Her practicing law did overlap with being First Lady of Arkansas, but not with being First Lady of the United States.    \\n\\nThe tag is meant for the article page, not the talk page. The article is currently around 67kb, which is long. / \\n\\n==Really being wikipedia NPOV: we need to treat people fairly, not have a double standard==\\nThe opening paragraph has been very slightly modified to match that of Christopher Dodd, another Democratic presidential contender.  We should treat them fairly and the same.  We still give Senator Clinton the honor of mentioning that she\\'s first lady and has several first.\\n\\nI don\\'t see how you can be against it unless you aren\\'t fair.  If this isn\\'t the case and you want to change it, explain why inconsistency is fair? \\n\\n:Why are you picking only Dodd?  Look at Barack Obama, John Edwards, John Kerry ... I\\'ve looked at \"1/3 to 1/2 of all the Senator articles, and all the 2008 presidential candidate articles, and there is absolutely no consistency among them in their intros.  But let me ask you this, what is your objection to the current intro?    \\n\\n::Dodd is from CT, that borders NY.  First, we make consistency between Dodd and Clinton, then we\\'ll worry about the others?  I can\\'t see how you can be for inconsistency.  It just isn\\'t fair!  And fairness and NPOV is what wikipedia is all about.  What\\'s so bad with Dodd\\'s intro?  It isn\\'t negative or inaccurate. \\n\\n:::Inconsistency of arrangement of neutral and unquestioned biographical details in an intro is not a matter of fairness or NPOV - it\\'s just plain old inconsistency - so your argument is a red herring.  Your chance of getting all these articles to have consistent intros is zero, take my word for it.  Your revised intro to this article wasn\\'t as good as the existing one, because it was a bit redundant and had faulty wikilinking.  Again, what is your agenda here?  What do you think is wrong with what we have?      \\n\\n::::For one thing, Dodd is called a politician, which he is.  Hillary\\'s occupation as politician is missing.  Someone is really a politician when they run for more than one office.  Jesse Ventura is difficult to call a politician cuz he just ran for one office then went back into wrestling or related jobs. \\n\\n:::::You are wrong about Ventura.  He was a mayor before he was governor and he was also involved in the shaping of third-party political organizations.  So he is a politician just as much as HRC or anyone else.  For the most part, however, I think it is redundant to say someone is a politician when you say they are a senator and running for president - obviously they are politicians.  I just sampled a bunch of articles, and maybe 1/3 use \\'politician\\' in the intro.  Being Wikipedia, it\\'s ve',\n",
       "       '\"==Expanding sections==\\nHello, I was wondering if there were some users out there that could maybe assist with the expansion of this Kingdom Hearts article. I\\'ve been spending the past week trying to cite and expand sections as best I can, but I\\'ve run into a few walls that I was hoping others might be able to help with.\\n\\n*The development section is missing information on any actual development of the game itself. There\\'s some info in the Kingdom Hearts (series)#Development section, but it isn\\'t cited. If anyone can find some developer interviews about the game that could be sourced, that would help expand that section.\\n\\n*The manga section is missing information on the Japanese publication/serialization.\\n\\n*There are a few statements that I tagged as citation needed that I wasn\\'t able to find any sources for. Admittedly, I wasn\\'t specifically looking for those information, but nothing came up in my general searches.\\n\\n*I\\'m currently trying to find the proper in-game dialog to cite some of the information in the setting and story sections. If any body would like to help, it would be appreciated.\\n\\n*One last thing, if anybody can get information from or has the Kingdom Hearts Ultimania, Kingdom Hearts Ultimania Revised Edition, and/or Kingdom Hearts Series Ultimania α ~Introduction of Kingdom Hearts II~, that could help expand and source the \"\"Development\"\" and \"\"Versions and merchandise\"\" sections.\\n\\nI\\'ll keep trying to find information as best I can, but I\\'m having a hard time finding the appropriate information in English, and my Japanese is limited. Any help would of course be appreciated, but if the list above can be addressed, I think it would greatly help in getting this article to \"\"Good Article\"\" status and hopefully eventually \"\"Featured Article\"\" status. ( )\\n\\n:GameFAQs has a script and journal text. I can\\'t help you much on the other stuff, as most of the interviews I find are only relevant to the later games and aren\\'t sourced very well. I commend you for your efforts to make a good article.  \\n\\n::Thanks for the game script link, that made getting the dialog much easier than trying to transcribe it from videos. I tired to find appropriate citations and I feel that the general story is cited well-enough, but others may disagree and add as they see fit.I found a little bit of info for some things and added a reference for one item needing citation, but am still looking for the others. After looking at the Kingdom Hearts#Setting section, I think it may need a rewrite. I think the people from the peer review will say that it is too much like game-guide information instead of encyclopedic material. I\\'ll try to paraphrase the information there in a separate edit to make any reverts easier, in case other editors are unhappy with the result. ( )\\n:::Great work overall. On \"\"Setting\"\", I wrote that section to emulate the style of Final Fantasy VII\\'s section, but I don\\'t mind your complete rewrite.  \\n\\n::::Thanks for the copy edit, I wasn\\'t too happy with the rewrite I did, it looks better now. I edited the \"\"Reception\"\" section to create a table of the ratings so that way they weren\\'t just listed one after another. If others think that it takes away from the article feel free to revert it.I\\'m thinking of doing a rewrite of the \"\"Characters\"\" section, the first two paragraphs read more like gameplay information. There is also no mention of the villains. I\\'ll do it in a separate edit again, in case it doesn\\'t turn out well. ( )\\n::Wow, finally some work being done. Thanks, Guyinblack25, for initiating this. I\\'ve had this article on my \"\"To FA\"\" list for some time but I never really got around to it. Anyway, I think I\\'m going to give it a thorough copyedit before adding new stuff.  \\n\\n:::Thanks. Please do, because I keep finding grammar edits or weird sentences after some of the rewrites I\\'ve done, I try to remember to fix them but they slip my mind. If you\\'re looking for new content to add, there is obviously the list above, but I also think the introduction could use some expanding if the article is to make further. After you made your revisions to the article, perhaps we should send it to the peer review to see what else can be done. ( )\\n::::Good plan. I just reworked the lead into three paragraphs like most FAs.  NEWLI',\n",

       "       '\"\\n\\nYou wrote:\\nThe term proto-Protestants has been in use now for quite a long time to describe religious movements sharing the beliefs very similar or even identical (as far as key issues are concerned) to those professed by Protestants of the 16the century. \\n\\nI was unable to find this definition online can you post a link.\\n\\nContinued:\\nThere clearly is a group of such movements, including the Waldensians, the Lollards, the Hussites, but also in the earlier centuries, the Vigilantians, the Aerians, the Helvidians, the Jovinians, whose views were identical to those of many Protestants.\\n\\nI don\\'t know that it is all that clear. Identical? Aerians insisted that the observance of Easter was a Jewish superstition and they fasted on Sundays. Not very Protestant. The Vigilantians argued against the veneration of relics, the sending of alms to Jerusalem, the rejection of earthly goods and the attribution of special virtue to the unmarried state, especially in the case of the clergy. No mention of the Bible, no mention of justification, nothing else Protestant. All that is known about Helvidius is that he did not believe in the Virgin Mary.  That doesn\\'t exactly make him a Protestant. Identical is laughable - there is no evidence to back up such an assertion. Wikipedia is not about truth, it is for fact that can be cited with recognized secondary sources of evidence.\\n\\nYou went on:\\nThis becomes even more obvious when we consider the fact, that the Waldensians, the Lollards and the Hussites joined the Reformation and often mixed with various Protestant groups. The Waldensian Church, still existing in Italy, is considered a Protestant group and not a sect, as User:Secisek tries to imply. This is because all key beliefs the Waldensians have professed since the 12th century are common to most Protestant groups and are different from those professed by sects considered heretical by both the Catholics and the Protestants.\\n\\nWhoa, I did not imply they were a sect, I wrote that they were. I intended no offense with that word. The Waldensians were a sect, and they revised their doctrine at the Reformation to conform to the new Protestant thinking. This is taken from the Waldensian\\'s article:\\n\\n\"\"In 1532 they met with German and Swiss Protestants and ultimately adapted their beliefs to those of the Reformed Church. Moreover, the Waldensian absorption into Protestantism led to their transformation from a sect on the edge of Catholicism that shared many Catholic beliefs into a Protestant church adhering to the theology of John Calvin, which differed much from the beliefs of Peter Waldo. From that moment the Church became the Italian branch of Reformed churches.\"\"\\n\\nThis contradict your assertion:\\nThe Waldensians have never altered their key beliefs, they are considered Protestants and still they had existed for over 3 centuries before the proper Protestants and the Reformation. Many scholars have used the term proto-Protestants in their articles, although there do exist historians who argue that the term should not be in use for various reasons.\\n\\nThe fact is, they have altered their key beliefs - that is what made them Protestant.\\n\\nThe problem is, however, that the Catholic historians often argue against the term to show that Protestants appeared only in the 16th century, while before them, there was just one Church of Christs and many small sects. For this reason even Waldensians, now considered a part of the Protestant Church even by the Church of Rome, are called a sect by Catholic historians. This dychotomy is absurd, as it implies that the Waldensians were at first a sect and then a Protestant group, while they have never changed their beliefs in the course of History. If the Waldensians are Protestants now, and they maintain the same views they professed in the late 12th century it means, that they have always been Protestants, even when the term had not been in use.\\n\\nThey have not maintained the same views, read the Waldensian article. They were still taking Roman Catholic Eucharist until the time of the Reformation, with the belief that the validity of the sacraments depends on the worthiness of the priest performing them. Seven sacrament is not very Protsestant.  \\n\\nI am not a Roman Catholic, nor do I care what Roman Catholic historians argue, although I am sure RC historians would at least acknowledge the existance of the Orthodox and Oriental Churches rather then maintain that there was \"\"just one Church\"\". The facts are quite clear - Protestants appeared in the 16th century for a variety of historical and cultural reasons that existed at that moment in history. They could not have appeared before that moment and it mental gerrymandering or wishful thinking to believe otherwise. I will be happy to discuss this further, but it seem that the',\n",

       "       '\":and like  said earlier, SoaD has a lot in common with Nu metal:\\n:*Generally speaking, the emphasis in the music is on either communicating feelings of angst and hostility, or motivating a crowd to move with the beat. - Yes, SoaD does not have teen angst, but it definitely does have emphasis on motivating the crowd to move with the beat. I must say, both in the music and lyrics. On \"\"BYOB,\"\" the chorus is extremely pop-like (from an alternative rock POV) and says \"\"Everybody\\'s going to the party have a real good time, Dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine\"\" which is an incitation to dance and \"\"move with the beat\"\". On \"\"Lost in Hollywood\"\", one part says \"\"All you bitches put your hands in the air\"\" which is another incitation to \"\"moving with the beat\"\" and is sounds like something a rapper would say (that\\'s my opinion).\\n:*Nu metal guitarists generally make liberal use of palm muting. - SoaD uses a lot of palm muting. First examples that pop up to my mind are \"\"BYOB\"\", \"\"Radio/Video\"\", and \"\"Old School Hollywood\"\".\\n:*Another common technique with nu metal guitarists is the use of de-tuned strings whose lower pitch creates a thicker, more resonant sound. - A technique that SoaD uses. \"\"BYOB\"\" is in Dropped C (I believe), but anyone with the slightest guitar knowledge would notice that SoaD are tuned down.\\n:*This is typical of nu metal bands in that guitar solos are rare in nu metal songs in general, and when they do appear they are often short. - SoaD have very few guitar solos, and if they do they are extremely short or do not emphasize on technicality (which, in general, is what most metal bands do in a guitar solo).\\n:*Nu metal bands often feature aggressive vocals that range from melodic singing akin to pop and rock, guttural screaming and shouting from various forms of metal, hardcore punk, and rapping. - SoaD uses (most of the time) melodic singing and shouting, and in some occasions uses some rap-like vocals (most notably in their \"\"Chop Suey\"\" intro and verses). Although it is not, properly speaking, rap, the link must be considered. I would still like to remind you that rapping does not necessarily make you a nu metal band, and that being a nu metal band does not necessarily means you rap. There are nu metal bands who don\\'t rap, and they are still nu metal.\\n:*Normally, nu metal songs have a song structure of instrumental introduction, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, sometimes another verse but almost always ending with a chorus. - This is characteristic of SoaD. Most of their songs (I\\'m not saying all of them) have a very simple \"\"verse-chorus-verse\"\" structure (as well as the slight variants).\\n:*It is generally louder in the instrumental parts and the choruses than in the verses. - Listen to \"\"Attack\"\" on their last album.\\n:*Another thing I\\'d like to mention is that Serj Tankian worked with Limp Bizkit (a well known nu metal band), Saul Williams (a hip-hop artist), M.I.A. (a rapper), and The Notorious B.I.G. (another rapper & hip-hop artist). The link to hip-hop and rapping with System of a Down\\'s lead singer is therefore established. I don\\'t have the material that Tankian produced with those artists, but seeing how those artists are predominantly hip-hop and nu metal (in Link Bizkit\\'s case), it is probable that the material is similar to hip-hop and nu metal in style. the \\'introduction, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge\\' is used by every genre of music: rock, country, punk, so that doesnt make them nu metal either\\n\\n\\n:SoaD is nu metal. Cheers Emmaneul  \\n\\nI feel that the only reason they were labeled as Nu Metal is because all of the hard/metal music that was popping up around that time was following Korn and adding the Hip Hop element. Because they happened to play music that was more hard or agressive than a rock band, they were considered Nu Metal.\\nAs for the things that  said, I can easily say how they are wrong. When he gives the reference about BYOB, and how that line \"\"everybody\\'s going to the party have a real good time, dancing in the desert blowing up the sunshine.\"\" That line is metaphorical. BYOB stands for bring your own bombs, going to the party is metaphorical for going to war, blowing up the sunshine in the desert is like dropping bombs in Iraq. So those lines dont have anything to do woth the crowd moving to the beat. The detuned guitar doesnt make nu metal either. metallica did their st anger album in drop c. and almost every hard rock/metal band today uses drop d or lower. the \\'introduction, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge\\' is used by every genre of music: rock, country,',\n",

Today, more than 1,000 Americans, Britons and others trying to \\nrebuild the nation have made it their temporary home.\\n\\n\"\"Think Vegas in the 1950s,\"\" Harvin said. \"\"Giant gold doors. Crystal \\nchandeliers. There are four big Saddam busts on the roof, as big as town \\nhouses. Have you seen the movie \\'Casino\\'? It\\'s living like that.\"\"\\n\\nAnd now - finally - the palace cafeteria serves a down-home favorite.\\n\\n\"\"This is sweet tea! This is South Carolina sweet tea!\"\" he announced to his \\nbuddies when he discovered just what he was drinking. \"\"No joke. This has \\nthe sugar boiled right into it.\"\"\\n\\nHarvin found out the source of the tea was an American cook whose mother \\nhails from Lake City.\\n\\nHarvin has been in Baghdad for three weeks. He has \"\"no clue\"\" when he will \\nreturn to Washington.\\n\\nIn the meantime, he said, his job is to serve the Iraqi people, the \\nAmerican cause here - and L. Paul Bremer, head of the American authority in \\nIraq.\\n\\n\"\"My role is to image Bremer, to make him look presidential, to give the \\nmedia access to him.\"\"\\n\\nBoth Harvin and Wolfe are putting in up to 20-hour days under trying \\nconditions. Electricity is not always reliable. Harvin sleeps under \\nmosquito nets. Wolfe said everything he wears is sweaty and dusty.\\n\\nThey can\\'t leave the palace - once called the Republican Guard Palace - \\nwithout an armed escort. And they are chilled by the recent spike in \\nAmerican casualties. Five soldiers died this week; four more were wounded.\\n\\nWolfe, once a partner in the Columbia law firm Nelson, Mullins, Riley and \\nScarborough, wears a bulletproof vest and a helmet whenever he ventures \\noutside the compound, three or four days a week.\\n\\nHe often returns with stories that astound him.\\n\\nIn the Southern city of Hillah, for example, Wolfe interviewed a group of \\nlocal bankers to \"\"take a sounding\"\" of the industry in the region. He wanted \\nto know about their deposits and withdrawals and whether they were making \\nloans and collecting payments.\\n\\nWhen he asked about security, one banker told him it could be better.\\n\\n\"\"Three weeks ago,\"\" Wolfe recalled, \"\"two guys come into his bank with \\nmachine guns and grenades and said if he didn\\'t give them change, they \\nwould blow up the bank.\"\"\\n\\nWolfe explained: The 10,000 Iraqi ',\n",
       "       '\"\\n ==Commented-out material==\\nThis article was a redirect for well over three years. Then the following material was added on September 18, 2007. Here\\'s what I removed. ...  \\n:==Why \\'Neo\\'-Darwinism==\\n \\n:There is no one theory of Neo-Darwinism. The term is commonly used to refer to currently accepted mainstream ideas about evolution  , which cannot properly be called \\'Darwinian\\' since Darwin\\'s hypothesis regarding the origin of the variation necessary for natural selection, which he called Pangenesis, is no longer accepted by most geneticists.\\n\\n:Darwin recognised several problems with his theory, which he was unable to solve. In 1859, when his seminal book The Origin of Species was published, nothing was known of DNA or genes, and very little about cell biology. He could not conceive of Mutation which is now considered to be the source of novel material in the evolutionary process. His theory of Pangenesis, which he published in The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, hypothesised that Gemmules, his imagined forerunners of genes, carried information to the next generation by accumulating in the germinal cells or zygotes and that they changed in response to use or disuse of the organs from which they were thrown off. Though Darwin did not acknowledge any debt to Lamarck, this was essentially a form a Lamarckism, now rejected by most mainstream scientists.\\n\\n:Despite the title of his book The Origin of Species Darwin did not explain speciation, and he recognised a problem. For natural selection to produce adaptive evolution, he considered that the changes in individual organisms that were the material for selection had to be small. Only then could successive generations move towards an optimum state for any trait. If the changes, whatever their origin, were too large, then they would constantly \\'overshoot\\' the desirable optimum, producing offspring that were forever badly adapted. This requirement for small change or Gradualism seemed destined to lead to stabilising selection, which was inconsistent with the observed fact that different species have somehow broken away and become very different from each other.\\n\\n:Darwin also assumed that characteristics were the result of \\'blending inheritance\\'; the mixing of contributions of both parents. In his book The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, he presents abundant evidence from animal and plant breeders, as well as common experience with human offspring, suggesting that in general some sort of average of the two parents was produced, though he recognised sports or throwbacks as the exception that was to him a mystery. He could not see how such blending might lead to anything other than the gradual dilution of variation, to the point of eventual elimination, which conflicted with the possibility of speciation. >\\n\\n\\n:== History and Useage ==\\n:The Ukranian I. I. Schmalhausen used the term in his seminal work Factors in Evolution which his colleague Theodosius Dobzhansky, described by Steven J. Gould as the central contributor to the modern evolutionary synthesis described as very important to the synthesis. He says, (p175) \"\"The Lamarckians based their theory on the premise of an already existing individual adaptability and did not examine its origin while the Neo-Darwinians regarded it as unimportant since they assumed that the results of individual adaptability, being non-inheritable, have no evolutionary value.\"\" He also says, (p198), \"\"Unfortunately, the more recent advances of genetics have promoted the spread of neo-Darwinian concepts. Morover, adaptive modifications generally have not been accorded any place among the factors of evolution.\"\"\\n\\n:The widely used school textbook Biology a Functional Approach says: \"\"The Darwinian theory reappraised in terms of modern genetics is sometimes called neo-Darwinism.\"\"\\n\\n:Richard Dawkins uses the term to when referring to current ideas, saying \"\"that idea means quite a complicated mixture of things\"\" but does not explicitly distinguish it from the ideas of the modern synthesis .\\n\\n:Steven J. Gould, one of the most published evolutionary theorists of modern times, used the term neo-Darwinism frequently . \\n\\n:Creationist articles often refer to the term neo-Darwinism, a fact that has led some people to conclude that the term is an invention of the creati',\n",
       "       '\"\\n:First, I would observe that there was a nearly unanimous consensus in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Winzapper to retain the article.  Every established user who commented at the AFD besides you supported retention of the article.  Under such circumstances, the AFD discussion would almost certainly have been closed as \"\"keep\"\" regardless of who closed it. I doubt that there would be many administrators willing to delete an article as a result of an AFD discussion in which many established users supported retention of the article, and not one established user besides the nominator supported deletion, unless the article constituted a serious WP:BLP violation, a copyright violation, or was otherwise exceptionally harmful, or there was clear evidence that comments favoring retention were the result of canvassing, abusive sockpuppetry, or other unacceptable activity.  Why?  Simply put, the strengths of arguments offered at AFD discussions do not exist as absolute quantities which are not subject to any reasonable dispute.  Instead, the perceived strength of arguments varies as a function of the person evaluating them.  So, an administrator who decided to delete an article in the face of essentially unanimous support of established users for retaining it would be putting himself in the position of claiming that his personal judgment regarding the merits of the arguments presented was so far superior to the judgment of every other established user who expressed an opinion at the AFD that his personal opinion properly outweighed nearly all others.  An administrator might properly advance such a claim only in rather exceptional circumstances, which were not present here.  This is not to say, however, that AFD discussions are decided purely by counting the votes of established users: they clearly are not.  Rather, the applicability of the principle that AFD is not a vote is subject to limitations, which are most clearly reached when there is absolutely no support by anyone except the nominator for the deletion of an article.  Administrators have been known, on occasion, to delete articles as a result of AFD discussions in which a clear majority of established users supported retention of the article, if they personally believe the arguments for deletion to be more firmly supported by Wikipedia policy or otherwise more persuasive; even in such cases, however, they generally require some substantial support for the deletion of an article before deleting it (though the supporters of deletion may be distinctly in the minority).\\n\\n:As a corollary to the principle that administrators quite rarely delete articles against a nearly unanimous consensus for retention at AFD, it is quite rarely the case that there would be a nearly unanimous consensus for the retention of an article that was in clear violation of Wikipedia policy or otherwise clearly needed to be deleted.  While it is true that Wikipedia\\'s verifiability and notability policies require that articles concern topics of which there is significant coverage in multiple third-party reliable sources, and while the presence of such sources in the article itself at the time of the AFD provides the clearest possible evidence of notability, there is no support, in either Wikipedia policy or practice, for the contention that any article which comes to AFD without the necessary sources to establish its notability, and to which no such sources are added during the AFD discussion, must therefore automatically be deleted.  Rather, where it is reasonably believed that the sources necessary to establish notability are likely to exist, the  community may choose to retain the article, even if such sources are not present at the time of the AFD.  So, if someone were to nominate, say, our article on the National Electrical Code for deletion on the grounds of inadequate sourcing and failure to establish notability, the article would properly be retained, even if sufficient sources weren\\'t produced during the AFD discussion.  Often, the belief that acceptable sources can be found for an article is little more than subjective opinion.  Consequently, arguments of the form \"\"keep, I believe this subject is notable\"\" are valid at AFD, if a sufficient number of established users assert them.  \"',\n",

He can\\'t waste all of his time in here, but I hope he can tarry a day or two and see if Michael can respond adequately, and in sequence, to the conditions  has set forth, in his successive interventions. Since the rest of us are not considered, by Michael, as being in good faith, but he himself has positively appraised \\'s own prior intervention here, I think the proper course would be for the rest of us to suspend our comments for a day or two and see how this new procedure might work?.

The oil price is flying to 100$ and this should led to think more seriously to our absurd world. But let\\'s go:\\n\\n1-there is someone that is costantly pointed at the \\'words\\' while others are pointed on \\'facts\\'. Since you call my comment \\'above\\' as non-polite, obviously you miss why i could be not friendly with someone that not miss a time to complain in Arbcom every time we discuss in any sense. This is \\'polite\\' and wikilove for you? To me it not looks so. Since i am a volonteer here, not payed (as all the collaborators as well), you cannot pretent i act like all the conformists here have established, and obey to Bzuk or BillCJ every time saying \\'yes master, yes master, like you want master\\'. And surely i wouldn\\'t take EH as \\'bright example\\'. Sorry, the manner in which they acted not displays any reasonable friendly-acting. So it\\'s hard pretend to me to be so kind with gentlemen that not even bothers to explain why they does this and that revert.\\n\\n2-Another thing that show dramatically well some things: \\n\\nTake for instance, the first paragraph after the header \"\"Technical description\"\"...the paragraph ends with the sentence \"\"the only real all-around fighter that served in AMI, but this was not without limitation in every task.\"\" That\\'s a very subjective statement, and, since it\\'s making a judgement, it really needs a citation so that the reader can understand what the source of that statement is. As it stands right now, however, because it is not cited, it merely looks like opinion on your part, which would be right to remove/revert.\\n\\nAll the G.91R page explains continuosly why this plane was \\'limited\\' and \\'mainly successful as recce\\'.

Strangely enough, this is \\'justified\\', rather than be a guilth. So, basically, every thing i do or not do is wrong, while every thing you do or not do is right. With these bases, expecting a costructive dialogue is just funny. You have been \\'offensed\\' by the vanification of F-104S adjustements (because i after done some more contr.). This is the only thing you did in over a month of \\'collaboration\\'. Too easy, my dear, to self justify all times like you. Easy not bothering to collaborate, while the guilth is mine that already lost my time to contribue gratis to this ency.\\n\\n4-My contributions should be alway quoted here and that. But being serious, there are a lot of pages without any or almost any references. I dont\\' understand why i should be whipped to post 500 kb. The issue about F-86 data touched the buttom of the sea and dig it too. I cannot cope with someone that not even read online sources with absurd reasons.\\n\\n5-The continuos accuses, diffamations and so on about me are not liked either. Perhaps the problem is that Wikipedia takes herself too seriously in the last times? Perhaps that be called \\'traitor\\' or \\'harmer\\' is not friendly? Obviously you rate these accusation as \\'righful critics\\'. But not i.\\n\\nI remember very well that you accused me without any proof to make copyviols, even with funny interpretations of Goebel PD text (that i stated as not mine, the only time i used other texts in all the MB written for the sake of Wiki). I wouldn\\'t have a judge like you in the real world, believe me.\\n\\n6-The fantastic wikioz world, \\'tooooo perfect\\' to be \\'questioned\\'. But to me and some others, this looks not exactly true. There are a lot of burocrats, hipocrites and trolls, or simply there are a lot of guys that basically fears the others and are ready to \\'defend the Revolution\\' with zealot fanatism. Questioning even the basical celebral activity and even the basical freedom of spreech, questioning even the simply syllogism. \\n\\nAll this is due because, as always in these cases, from French revolution today there are always many \\'revolutionary guards\\' ready to show their \\'loyalty\\' to the \\'cause\\'. So wikipedia prefers executes guys \\'out of the chor\\' instead to admit to have some \\'contradictions\\'. This is the usual manner to act. And i have no love to who call me \\'wiki.harmer\\' just because i show that i \\'know\\' my stuff, not only \\'have read it somewhere\\'. This is why Goebel and many others keeps away from',\n",

       "       '\"\\n\\n== Dubious sentence ==\\n\\n\"\"Consequently, Ney now organised a combined arms (infantry, artillery and cavalry) attack on La Haye Sainte, which fell as the defending King\\'s German Legion troops ran out of ammunition. Ney then moved artillery up to the allied centre and began to pulverise the infantry squares.[73]\"\"\\n\\nThis is the final sentence of the French Cavalry attack section.\\n\\nThere seem to be several things wrong with it: first, attacking a building with cavalry is pointless, be they with infantry or not, second, field artillery have little effect on reasonably stout (like Belgian farmhouses) buildings, apart from shells setting them alight (which is what happened to the Chateau de Goumont, to little effect).\\n\\nI think two events are being conflated here.  \\n\\nHaving become obvious that the cavalry on their own were achieving little, Ney organised a combined arms attack, using Bachelu\\'s Division (Reille\\'s Corps) and the remaining French cavalry in a fit enough state, towards the centre of Wellington\\'s position, this was halted by the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge (who couldn\\'t break the French infantry formations, and consequently the British cavalry then fell back). Uxbridge then tried to lead the Dutch-Belgian heavy cavalry into the attack but they refused to charge.  Meanwhile, Bachelu\\'s men and their cavalry supports were being hard hit by artillery fire and eventually fell back themselves.  \\n\\nSimultaneously, or thereabouts, elements of D\\'Erlon\\'s Corps renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte, and were ultimately successful.\\n\\n \\n\\n:If you can reference all of that, be bold and put it in! - \\n\\n:: Done (I\\'m bloody, bold and resolute - in Shakespeare\\'s words ;)  ) \\n\\n== Artillery ==\\n\\nOne omission and one challenge. \\n\\nWe should say something about Wellington\\'s tactic of having his gun crews seek shelter in the infantry squares during the cavalry attacks. There is also Mercer\\'s account of not doing so because he reckoned if his men ran for the Brunswick squares next to them, the Brunswickers would run too. He gives a great eyewitness account of what happened to cuirassiers when you fired canister at them at point-blank range, too. \\n\\nNow the challenge. What\\'s the source for there being only 54 guns in the Grand Battery? French \"\"batteries\"\" (field brigades, or companies, perhaps, more correctly) had eight guns. There should have been either 48 or 56, i.e. 6 or 7 batteries, as otherwise it would imply at least one incomplete unit, or that some weapons were detached for some reason. I don\\'t recall any suggestion from elsewhere that that happened. Were there perhaps 54 guns east of the Brussels road?  \\n\\n\\nAdkin, p. 296, has forty two 6lb, eighteen 12lb cannon, and six 6in and fourteen 5.5in howitzers - eighty pieces of ordnance in total from 10 artillery companies (of 8 pieces each).  This is for the period 1:00 to 1:30 pm.\\n\\n6th Foot Artillery: 9th, 10th, 11th, 19th and 20th companies\\n\\n8th                4th company\\n\\n2nd                7th company\\n\\nMarines of the Guard Foot Artillery: 2 companies (undifferentiated)\\n\\nOld Guard Foot Artillery: 6th company.\\n\\n \\n\\nThanks - and those figures are consistent with what I know of French artillery organisation, i.e. each 8-gun foot artillery company had 6 guns and two howitzers. Your source shows 20 howitzers in total which says they had the howitzers of 10 companies, hence 80 guns - so it ties in. The eighteen 12-pounders would be the guns of three companies and the six 6in howitzers would have been theirs.\\n\\nI wonder if someone miscounted by adding up just the guns and forgot to include the howitzers? That would get you close to 54 guns. Or perhaps 54 guns is what they had left after the Union Brigade got done with them.  \\n\\nI vote we change it. At present the article implies that there was a 54-gun battery which covered the entire length of Wellington\\'s position, and that this dilution of fire accounted for its relative ineffectiveness.  \\n\\nBy all means change it.  \\n\\n==Format==\\nIn my internet explorer is the formating of the page rather strange.

       "       '\"\\n\\n== NASA Study Debunks Part of Global Warming ==\\nNASA Sees Arctic Ocean Circulation Do an About-Face\\nNovember 13, 2007\\n\\nPASADENA, Calif. – A team of NASA and university scientists has detected an ongoing reversal in Arctic Ocean circulation triggered by atmospheric circulation changes that vary on decade-long time scales. The results suggest not all the large changes seen in Arctic climate in recent years are a result of long-term trends associated with global warming.\\n\\nThe team, led by James Morison of the University of Washington\\'s Polar Science Center Applied Physics Laboratory, Seattle, used data from an Earth-observing satellite and from deep-sea pressure gauges to monitor Arctic Ocean circulation from 2002 to 2006. They measured changes in the weight of columns of Arctic Ocean water, from the surface to the ocean bottom. That weight is influenced by factors such as the height of the ocean\\'s surface, and its salinity. A saltier ocean is heavier and circulates differently than one with less salt.\\n\\nThe very precise deep-sea gauges were developed with help from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the satellite is NASA\\'s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (Grace). The team of scientists found a 10-millibar decrease in water pressure at the bottom of the ocean at the North Pole between 2002 and 2006, equal to removing the weight of 10 centimeters (four inches) of water from the ocean. The distribution and size of the decrease suggest that Arctic Ocean circulation changed from the counterclockwise pattern it exhibited in the 1990s to the clockwise pattern that was dominant prior to 1990.\\n\\nReporting in Geophysical Research Letters, the authors attribute the reversal to a weakened Arctic Oscillation, a major atmospheric circulation pattern in the northern hemisphere. The weakening reduced the salinity of the upper ocean near the North Pole, decreasing its weight and changing its circulation.\\n\\n\"\"Our study confirms many changes seen in upper Arctic Ocean circulation in the 1990s were mostly decadal in nature, rather than trends caused by global warming,\"\" said Morison.\\n\\n\"\"While some 1990s climate trends, such as declines in Arctic sea ice extent, have continued, these results suggest at least for the \\'wet\\' part of the Arctic  the Arctic Ocean  circulation reverted to conditions like those prevalent before the 1990s,\"\" he added.\\n\\nThe Arctic Oscillation was fairly stable until about 1970, but then varied on more or less decadal time scales, with signs of an underlying upward trend, until the late 1990s, when it again stabilized. During its strong counterclockwise phase in the 1990s, the Arctic environment changed markedly, with the upper Arctic Ocean undergoing major changes that persisted into this century. Many scientists viewed the changes as evidence of an ongoing climate shift, raising concerns about the effects of global warming on the Arctic.\\n\\nMorison said data gathered by Grace and the bottom pressure gauges since publication of the paper earlier this year highlight how short-lived the ocean circulation changes can be. The newer data indicate the bottom pressure has increased back toward its 2002 level. \"\"The winter of 2006-2007 was another high Arctic Oscillation year and summer sea ice extent reached a new minimum,\"\" he said. \"\"It is too early to say, but it looks as though the Arctic Ocean is ready to start swinging back to the counterclockwise circulation pattern of the 1990s again.\"\"\\n\\nMorison cautioned that while the recent decadal-scale changes in the circulation of the Arctic Ocean may not appear to be directly tied to global warming, most climate models predict the Arctic Oscillation will become even more strongly counterclockwise in the future. \"\"The events of the 1990s may well be a preview of how the Arctic will respond over longer periods of time in a warming world,\"\" he said.\\n\\nGrace monitors tiny month-to-month changes in Earth\\'s gravity field caused primarily by the movement of water in Earth\\'s land, ocean, ice and atmosphere reservoirs. As such it can infer changes in the weight of columns of ocean water. In contrast, the pressure gauges installed on the sea floor in 2005-2006 directly measured water pressure at the bottom of the ocean. Gauge data were remotely recovered during the first year of the study.\\n\\n\"\"The close agreement between the North Pole pressure gauges and Grace data demonstrates Grace\\'s potential for tracking world ocean circulation,\"\" said study co-author John Wahr of the University of Colorado, Boulder.\\n\\n\"\"Satellite altimeters, such as NASA\\'s Jason, are ideal for studying ocean circulation but can\\'t be used at Earth\\'s poles due to ice cover,\"\" said study co-author Ron Kwok of NASA\\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif. \"\"Our results show Grace can be a powerful tool for trac',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n== Israeli-Palestinian conflict protect? ==\\n\\nYesterday there were relevent and reliably-sourced casualty figures added to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict article, and some editors objected to this. It seems you were called in to quickly \"\"protect\"\" the page from editing, effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures. You cited \"\"edit warring,\"\" the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons. There are casualty figures in all the conflict, war, battle etc. Wiki articles I have referenced, why not this one? Thanks   \\n:RomaC, the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only, which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years. This article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity. The fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself. Here at Wikipedia, we value the ability to achieve consensus, and to be fair to many viewpoints. And believe it or not, we often do achieve that at the article Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were \"\"reliable,\"\" without addressing any of the underlying issues, or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused. \\n\\n:To repeat: statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the article\\'s lead. there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote, all in the name of objectivity, which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other. please note, this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus, rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus.   \\n\\n::I strongly object to your calling me \"\"disinegnuous\"\" [sic]. You wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with Hertz1888, who argued that the statistics might be biased. Do you not regard Haaretz as a reliable source? Please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliably-sourced and up-to-date civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war, battle or conflict is disingenuous. If you or any other editor want to add more statistics, covering a longer time period, then go ahead, but do not delete relevant content added by other editors. Yes, the edit \"\"sparked so much conflict and opposition\"\" but note also also that here at Wikipedia we do not determine what is \"\"fair\"\" through intimidation by numbers. There is a big difference between consensus and false compromise.   \\n\\n:::I apologize if you felt I was offending you in any way. i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits, not to describe you personally in any way. if other editors deleted some edits, it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so, and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article. I responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page. thanks.    \\n\\n::::Apology accepted, and I will also make my further comments on the article talk page. I am not a single-issue editor I get around a bit on Wiki, saw the Haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article. I can\\'t say I know for certain why other editors deleted the material, I try to assume good faith, we\\'ll see.   \\n:\"\"repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons\"\" - motive doesn\\'t really matter, its still edit warring, its still disruptive. Protection is not an endorsement of the current version.  \\n::The subject of this article is a deadly conflict, the lede is huge - and yet it contains no mention of the casualties. Clearly, there is something seriously wrong. As a result, your action here, while well-intentioned, looks highly partisan. Worse than that, it looks rather like like a cynical move to protect deniers, those who wish to cover up atrocities, the mass killings of (mostly) unarmed civilians, in many cases recognised by Western sources as war-crimes. If the events at this article really offend you, it would be a lot better to lock it at the alternative version.  10:39, ',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n== Roman era/Byzantine/Greek colonies/ Illyrian Albanian/edit wars/Epir plz read all my message ==\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the dark and solemn days of the wondrous lands, which would later be called the Balkans, there existed two people. \\nOne, that would later be known as the Greek people, and the other, the men that would form the nation of Albania. For centuries these two cultures would have many periods of cultural exchange and of cultural strife.\\n\\nMost of scholars and philologists alike contend that the modern Albanian language to be descended from Illyrian.(check the atlas of world in Barnes Noble,see where they put the Albanian languange)\\n\\nThe Illyrian name is understood in the Albanian interpretation of the Illyrians, \"\"Ilirët.\"\"\\n\\nThe root in \"\"Ilirët\"\" is \"\"i lir\"\" which simply means, \"\"FREE.\"\" Thus, the meaning of \"\"Ilirët\"\" is \"\"freemen\"\" and the meaning of Illyria (long before America came into existence) is \"\"land of the free.\"\" \\n\\nThe first references,that of 1285 cf.Jirecek 1901,1904,Ajeti 1977,1982,occurs not in Albania itself but in Dubrovnik(Ragusa) where a sizeable Albaniancommunity had existed for some time.In the investigation of a robbery in the house of Petro del Volcio of Belena(now Prati),a certain Matthew,son of Mark of Mançe, who appears to have been witness to the crime states:\\n\"\"Audivi unam vocem clamantem in monte in lingua Albanesca\"\" \"\" I heara a voice crying in the mountains in the Albanian languange\"\"\\nand I sure those who study Albanian history have 4 more importan references.(they should know that)\\n\\nWhat is the significance of these references? First and foremost, it is apparent that in the period 1285 to 1322 the Albanian languange was well-established on the southeastern Adriatic coast.\\n\\nThe dating of these refernces,should not however be taken as an indication that Albanian or early forms of it were not spoken in the preceding centuries.If the Albanians,tells us were rural nomads,warlike inhabitants,and if their settlements were more concentrated in the highlands than on the coast,it is quite likely that they were not taken note of, even though they may have costituted at substantial population group. \\n\\nMost historians of the Balkans believe the Albanian people are in large part descendants of the ancient Illyrians, who, like other Balkan peoples, were subdivided into tribes and clans. The name Albania is derived from the name of an Illyrian tribe called the Arbër, or Arbëresh, and later Albanoi, that lived near Durrës.Only Albanians preserve the Illyrian names ex; me my name is Taulant-Taulantët illyrians tribes, Genti,Bardhyl,Dori,Boiken,Bato etc etc so the question is How come Albanians are the only one to preserve this names and languange? and NO its not communist propaganda, my greatgrandfather\\'s name was Bardhyl and his dads was Agroni.\\n\\nThe most known Illyrian sign is the snake or dragons rolled or twisted, that Illyrians used in their shields & in their art.Dragons and snakes were worshiped by Illyrians, they still continue to exist until this day in Albanian mythology...\\n\\nGreek roots with Illyrian its a stupid argument,mixing oil with water,I never heard that Greeks claiming Illyrians.One point its true, some did mix with Greeks, I am sure not everyone was isolated on southern Illyria from the Albanian hardesh geography or imigrated towards Italy.\\nGreeks have their old history and I don\\'t think they need Illyrians to prove that.\\n::I was the one who started the Greek colonies because they show that we all have a worked together but never thought that it will end up like this, with maps to be used for nationalistic ideas,to claim lands.Epir it was and is to the Albanians,Greeks,Albanian-Greeks,Greeks-Albanian people. We need to show some respect,from those mountaints of north west of Greece (south of Albania) Pyrros, Bubullima,Boçari etc called home.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t like nationalist of any kind, its 2008 people,there is thousand of books about Albanians,wake up, but to delete critical points that linked Albanians with Illyrians its wrong,shame on u people, it makes Wikipedia looks bad and it shows that some people still leave in the past.\\n::All these Roman/Byzantine/Greekcolonies articles need to be on one article,they are too long.I would suggest  to help in here,I really do think he is the only (Greek) Wikipedian that can really help and has an open mind.\\n\\n\\nWe know that the shadow of the ancient Greece was too strong/too close for the Illyrian Albanian civilization, but at least try to understand that not everyone who dresses Levis, listens to hip-hop or writes grafitti in English ... is an American........ \"',\n",

Géographie de M. Robbe. Méthode pour apprendre facilement la Géographie, divisée en deux Tomes. (Tome Premier). Contenant un Abbrégé de la Sphère, la Division de la Terre)\\nThe article below describes how the cham were expelled by the greek.\\n\\n== Napoleon Zervas ==\\n\\n\"\"Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced\"\" This quote came from Wikepedia\\'s biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi\\'s. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi\\'s that expelled them. Shouldn\\'t this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:\\n\\n\\nCopyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.\\nDuring the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.\\n\\nChams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.\\n\\nAs a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.\\n\\nThe population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria\\'s population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book \"\"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia\"\", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that \"\"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek\"\" .\\n\\nThe Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria\\'s muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.\\n\\nOn June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.\\n\\nDuring the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed',\n",

       "       \"\\n\\n== David Shankbone is traumatizing notable authors ==\\n\\nDavid Shankbone's attitude toward authors who don't like the photos he's taken of them is bossy and bullying.  He takes disastrous photos of authors.  Taking more unflattering photos could hardly be possible (See Edmund White, A.M. Homes, Francine Prose, Kathryn Harrison, Mary Gaitskill).  It's gotten to the point that authors he hasn't assaulted yet with his camera are afraid to go to readings for fear he'll be there, waiting for them.   I don't spend much time on Wikipedia, but when I come upon an author's page with a terrible photo, I now know it's been taken by David Shankbone.  I became curious about how these authors felt about the photos he'd taken of them, so I went and looked back in the history of a couple of them.  First I checked in the history of A.M. Homes, and sure enough, someone tried to take down the Shankbone photo (possibly even A.M. Homes herself or someone close to her), saying it was not a good photo, and he repeatedly put it back.  I also looked in the history of Sharyn November, and she herself had an exchange with him on one of their talk pages saying she preferred another photo of herself instead, but he would not let her have her way, and I don't remember the details, but his attitude was unpleasant and bossy.  She quickly backed down sweetly. \\n\\nA few days ago I came upon yet another disastrous author photo by David Shankbone and decided to Google his name, because I've been thinking that sooner or later an article will inevitably come out in the print media about authors' frustrations with this offensive photographer.  I wanted to see if any articles had been published yet about it.  I didn't dig very deeply but did find that on February 18th, 2008, lots of Wikipedia editors wrote about their frustrations with David Shankbone (in a section called: Does Wikipedia want David Shankbone or should we just tell him to leave?), to the point that he promised he'd leave Wikipedia (he shouldn't make promises he won't keep-he didn't even leave for one day, as far as I can see from his list of contributions).   All those posts from upset people have been deleted from Wikipedia, but I was able to find them by going into the history of the page: Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents.  \\n\\nAuthors are not the only celebrities Shankbone has upset.  I came upon discussions (on Wikipedia) about the actor Mike Farrell, who was upset by the photo Shankbone took of him, but Shankbone insisted his photo stay up on Farrell's page (it has now been replaced by a much better photo taken by someone else).  And I'm sure it's happened to countless other “notables”.  Many notable authors who are distressed by their photo will just remain quiet and try not to look at their Wikipedia pages, either because they don't know how to take down photos and post messages on Wikipedia, or because they fear that fighting David Shankbone will be futile and will  only increase their distress.  \\nAuthors are often shy and insecure about their physical appearance.  Why make it worse?  And why be stubborn and nasty about it to the few authors who do muster up the courage to request that an unflattering photo be taken down? \\n\\nAs with any contributor to Wikipedia, David Shankbone should have no right to assert that his photos take precedence over the photos of others, especially when more appropriate pictures are available and copyright free.  He claims that he has allowed better pictures to take the place of his, but this is clearly not true in many instances, given the way he fights to retain his pictures even in instances when any reasonable third party observer would agree that another picture is either better or more appropriate for the article.  \\n\\nDavid Shankbone might be using Wikipedia to try and make a career for himself, and maybe that's okay, but he's hurting a lot of people along the way.  \\n\\nI am an author, with a few published books, and there is a page on me on Wikipedia.  That's why I care about this issue.   I'm appalled at what David Shankbone is doing to authors.  \\n\\nAs I don't know the best place to post this message, I'm posting it in three places: David Shankbone's talk page, Jimbo Wales' talk page, and Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents. \\n\\n  \",\n",

       "       '\"\\n\\n==Suggestions==\\n\\n(1) Might it be useful to \"\"update\"\" Wittgenstein\\'s contributions to various academic and philosophical inquiries? It seems that Wittgenstein\\'s use of language games and place of language in experience has experienced something of a revival among some postmodern academics. \\n\\nIn particular, his own transition from \"\"representational\"\" to \"\"lived\"\" semiotic is in itself interesting as a presage of the movement from a \"\"representational\"\" to a \"\"community\"\" derivation of language / meaning. \\n\\nI\\'m no Wittgenstein expert (just stumbled upon this interesting, if frustrating, discussion) and any credentials I might have had to the \"\"philosopher\\'s club\"\" have probably long expired, but a part of my doctoral work did float in and around meaning, words, classification and the uses we make of themvia semiotics. Thus I am eminently unqualified to write such a piece, though I can see a hole on the bookshelf where something like it might just fit. \\n\\nThat is, philosophy did not end with Adorno, or even with Habermas. Some young buck out there, can you tell whether this connection (Wittgenstein\\'s work on language and postmodern approaches to community-as-language) has developed at all in contemporary (21st century) philosophical work? \\n\\nMight be nice to see something pragmatic as well as historic. . .(of course they are not mutually exclusive. . .)\\n\\n(2) On the issue of Wittgenstein\\'s alleged personal quirks:\\n\\nGiven the absolute delight with which students of philosophy embrace all that is eccentric in the lives of the authors with whose works they are cursed to try and read (see Philosopher\\'s Song. . .any campus)\\n\\nand \\n\\nthe somewhat unsettling popular idea that the most brilliant men (almost always men) are proportionately looney (perhaps explaining the less-brilliant lives of mostly normal people?) as well as\\n\\nthe difficulty of actually nailing down with precise sources most of what happened in Europe during either of the \"\"world wars,\"\" but in particular the secondthere was an awful lot of bombing and burning by both sides\\n\\nit might be difficult to come up with primary source material that would either confirm or deny even positions held forth in academic lectures but unpublished, let alone personal eccentricities (after all, if the people writing about these eccentricities were themselves brilliant, their own opinions of normalcy should be correspondingly suspect, see the \"\"it takes one to know one\"\" argument)\\n\\nSo\\n\\nperhaps we should cobble together a \"\"tribute\"\" page to which all of the strange and probably unprovable and just as probably unimportant traits, stunts, personal traits, learned tricks and inept relationships of all such \"\"brilliant but eccentric\"\" wiki subjects can point?\\n\\nThus the eccentricities (which, if not so important, are entertaining enough that folks will be motivated to search dilligently for evidence enough to warrant a smirk) can be acknowledged with a neat and proper cite through a proper point to another wikipedia page\\n\\nbut \\n\\nthe \"\"eccentricities\"\" page itself would be self-evidently immune from the precision of source usually required of biographies of thought, (by the way, why is it we assume that someone\\'s date and place of birth is important to the formation of their intellectual ideas?) \\n\\nand would be a riotous read. (potentially Wiki\\'s most commonly cited article)\\n\\nThis might satisfy both the \"\"biography of ideas\"\" and the \"\"biography of real peoples behind the ideas\"\" folks by allowing the hint or shadow of perhaps something utterly crazy to fall across the screen without an actual commission of the crime of citing one wack-o\\'s account of another wack-o (non-traditional spelling intentional).\\n\\nParadoxically, this page might already exist, and merely lacks more \"\"slept with sheep but only within a platonic framework\"\" entries in order to accumulate enough word-weight to produce a big enough ripple when it is dropped into the swimming pool of ideas.

       "       '\"== Poster ==\\n\\nDoes the poster for this article look fake to anyone other than me? (talking mainly about the title part)    \\n\\n:Reverted. Thanks for bringing it up!   \\n\\noi todo bem!!!!!!!!!!!!!  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    \\n\\n== Romeo and Juliet comparison ==\\n\\nThis is the quote I found from the source given (the other source seems to be a dead link):\\n\"\"\"\"Our story line is maybe not the most original or creative, but it\\'s Shakespearean,\"\" said Borden, who described the plot as a modern version of Romeo and Juliet. \"\"We took from the best.\"\"\"\"\\n\\nI see this has been discussed before and there doesn\\'t seem to be a conclusion, so let me give my two cents. The story of a boy and a girl falling in love with each other but not getting their way is probably the most common theme in the world, and that\\'s the only resemblance between those the movie and Romeo and Juliet. There\\'s an enormous difference - Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, for one. Let\\'s just say that this movie is nothing like Romeo and Juliet.\\n\\nMoreover, if you have a basic knowledge of Shakespeare, you will know that Shakespeare created nothing. His story of Romeo and Juliet comes from an earlier story of the same name, which in turn comes from the Metamorphoses by Ovid, who probably heard the story as a folktale. His other tragedies - Hamlet, King Lear - are the same. The true excellence of Shakespeare is in his ability to transform them masterfully into blank verse. It has nothing to do with creativity, and here Borden is awfully wrong to claim that the best is Shakespeare\\'s plot - which has been around for centuries. It shows a lack of basic knowledge about what he supposedly based his story on.\\n\\nAll this raises doubt to the amount of truth in Borden\\'s claim that he based it on Romeo and Juliet - is it babbling, or is he simply ignorant? We do not know. But we do know that his comparison is, at best, doubtful. Yes, it is a verifiable source, it comes from the writer\\'s own mouth, and it is not my place to judge him wrong, but it is also against the principle of common sense to make the comparison in an encyclopedia based on one sentence out of the writer\\'s mouth - as far as I know, no one yet has made this comparison and no one seems to see the same way. I would suggest moving the sentence below to the plotline as \"\"The writer of the play claimed that...\"\" as it is not exactly a notable claim either (nowhere else in the article is it mentioned, except briefly in what I believe is an OR sentence). Or, better, remove it.   \\n:I think the editor seemed to feel that what Borden said was sufficient. I\\'d be a little dubious because; besides it being possibly self-promotion, the only thing we can grab without a shadow of a doubt that (like what you said about the Bard) they weren\\'t that creative.    \\n\\n::Ok - I have now posted 5 more references not from the author, but from mainstream critics who easily saw the similar elements. I also fixed the dead link. I also retooled the sentence to say that both the author and numerous critics have made the same (or similar) description.  As to the obvious similarities: meeting at a party, a balcony scene, each has their \"\"gangs\"\", the thwarting of a parents will, rival cliques instead of rival gangs is also referenced by 3 different critics. May this be the end to this conversation now? Thanks for allowing me to post more references.  Please read them all and you might learn something.  \\n:::Oh yes - of course their are elements of Grease and West Side Story - They too were based on elements of the R&J; story. I feel silly even having to point this stuff out, but it keeps coming up. Let\\'s see - Grease wasn\\'t a tragedy either (except its message of \"\"dress and act like a slut and you will be accepted\"\".  Shakespeare created nothing? Gee, I guess that is why R&J; is perhaps the most adapted play of all time. See the wiki article on Romeo and Juliet on screen just for a taste of what the play has inspired.  No one has adapted Ovid and few have even read Romeus and Iuliet (I have though - has anyone on this page read it?). I sincerely doubt if Bordon or many critics have.

       "       '\"\\n\\n=Replacement=\\n\\nPLEASE DO NOT EDIT BELOW THIS NOTE. THE WHOLE SUPRA-SECTION WILL DISAPPEAR AGAIN ONCE I AM ABLE TO POST ON THE ARTICLE TALK PAGE.\\n\\nThis includes you Shell. Had you not blocked me, I would have been able to place my answers there. This will disappear tomorrow so you can put with it until then.\\n\\nBecause Shell falsely blocked me, I cannot save my replies on a certain article talk page. Hence I will save the entire page (minus the archived sections) here.\\n\\n== POV concerns ==\\n\\nIm surprised this article isn\\'t being called anti-semetic, because it\\'s has a *few* traces of Islamic perspectives in it. You know, as opposed to being a piece of Zionist propaganda being passed off as fair and balanced.\\n\\nThis entire article is full of baseless jewish propaganda. It is well documented the Banu Qurayza were executed for treason. That is what merited them the death penalty, that they commited treason. The Quarash and other tribes the Muslims fought against were outright enemies who were persecuting them from the start. But the Qurayza signed a peace treaty, then broke it by aiding the enemy. This article contains soo much jewish propaganda that you\\'d think they were executed for no reason (which no doubt is their aim). Here is a great example. Look at this citation\\n\\n\"\"According to Stillman, Muhammad chose Sa\\'d ibn Mua\\'dh so as not to pronounce the judgment himself after the precedents he had set with the Banu Qaynuqa and the Banu Nadir: \"\"Sa\"d took the hint and condemned the adult males to death and the hapless women and children to slavery.\"\" Furthermore, Stillman infers from Abu Lubaba\\'s gesture that Muhammad had decided the fate of the Qurayza even before their surrender.\"\"\\n\\nThis author is Norman A Stillman, a Zionist Jew who is very biased. Why is he being used as a quote in an Islamic article? And further more, why is his baseless conjecture allowed to be used, as if it\\'s a fact?\\n\\nThere are articles for \"\"Criticisms of Islam\"\" where the Jews and others can write whatever they want. But they should have no hand in editing Islamic articles. Because I looked up the Jewish articles and I noticed they dont allow dissent there. You cant put a Muslim perspective on evil acts commited by Jews, without it disappearing instantly. So the same standard MUST be applied to Islamic articles. Islamic articles must be written from the Islamic point of view, and the jews can write their responses in appropriate \"\"criticisms of Islam\"\" articles. If not, I will personally edit the Jewish articles and fill them with my conjectures about their history. And I will find a non-Jewish admin to arbitrate over the Islamic articles.\\n\\nGood day.\\n\\n  \\n\\n:Please read this talk page, specifically all of the places where \"\"treason\"\" or \"\"traitor\"\" is mentioned, and if you still believe that we need to mention treason, provide some reliable sources and we can discuss it.  It is easy for our article to be neutral and mention all POVs, but it does require that people like yourself participate.  We work from academic sources, not personal conjecture.   \\n\\n==Changes by Devotus and issues with them==\\n\\nDear Devotus, \\nI have still issues with your changes:\\n*Bat Yeor and Ramadan - while I appreciate that you don\\'t try you shift the balance - removing a book from \"\"each side\"\" - I do not agree with your removal. Bat Yeor is an academic scholar and though her books are controversial, she is not beyond the pale - currently she doesn\\'t serve as a reference in the article but if she did, the controversy would be noted. As for Ramadan I have issues with him as well but if we remove him from the literature section, we would have to remove him from the article too, in which he serves as a reference. This is due to the insistence of . He will certainly not like such a removal. We cannot remove him from the literature section while retaining him in the article.\\n*While your first version was needlessly verbose (\"\"it is to be noted that\"\"), the new one endorses that view by Paret/Watt. The article now says that the BQ were not killed for religious reasons - that is not a fact, since there is a good case that the whole conflict was caused by religious differences.\\n*Also we do not want to repeat things that have already been said in the coverage of the \"\"siege and demise\"\", e.g. the claim about attacking M. in the rear.\\n*Also, please abide by the one resolved conflict. We fought hard and long about words like \"\"massacre\"\" and \"\"execution\"\" and neither should appear unless unavoidable.\\n*The common practice thing is unacceptable as it is s',\n",
       "       '\"== Unblock requests ==\\n\\n{{unblock reviewed|1=Sorry for my blurb here, I went in detail elsewhere. If an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology, they will notice that I\\'ve been patient while I had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. That creates a very stressful situation. Please see here for outside opinion. I did not use the same kind of language against Hrafn, and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while I added content to the article. I was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it, even before the AfD process. I noticed it was a stub and started to add content. How am I being disruptive to other there, when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? I even listed 30 potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. Others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be \"\"an editor of astrotheology\"\" and *add content*. Hrafn, on the talk page, even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. It is obvious he was against something, but that something wasn\\'t me like he thought, and he couldn\\'t believe otherwise  or choose not to. Somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment I got from Hrafn, to where Durova stepped in and it went directly to ArbCom. She did ask about PastorDavid, but I looked and I left evidence on AN/I of why I didn\\'t accept his offer  that is not a refusal to dispute resolution, that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an AfD. I felt another mentor/mediator, would be best. (Personal attack/comment redacted by   ) If you look however, I did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to Hrafn about RS/N over the Physico-Theology book... he didn\\'t answer at all to that question, but he went on to despise me instead with more \"\"egregious misintrepretations.\"\" As for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that Durova noted, those weren\\'t because of disruptive editing. I never caused anybody to leave wikipedia. If you seriously think I did, it would be more appreciate if you mentioned that evidence to support it than just baselessly blame me. The previous mediation was recommended by a mentor, (Comments redacted by   ) I hate the show the mistakes she made also, we aren\\'t all-knowing saints of wikipedia policy from day one. Why did she even bring it old beginnings back up? The computer science related one was dealt with differently since it was called unfair why I got blocked before. After unblock, the consensus continued , and it still sustains today. If I truly was trying to disrupt like Durova claims, don\\'t you think a intentional disrupter would stalk her and revert her edits and such all along. (Comment redacted by   ) It would be a test to see if she requests unblock, but since she made it clear on my talk page she never want to see me again, I really doubted her olive branch. I deleted a section here on my talk page of her \"\"vanish\"\" forever bit. I simply did not reply to her, (Comment redacted by   ) You can argue all you want that I changed the section title, which policy does allow for neutral view, (Comments redacted by   ) When ArbCom said this is obvious, I truly don\\'t think he meant to block me... the obvious answer is let the community help  offer to help mediate. I saw absolutely no other offer to help mediate besides PastorDavid\\'s. However, I sent an e-mail to ask her \"\"why... why.. why..\"\"... but now she is calling it \"\"obscene,\"\" and offers to show it to any admin. If you read it(Comment redacted by   ) Like I said on AN/I...|decline=reason — Not only has the user not apologized for obvious bad behavior, but has offered further attacks and emails with multiple four letter words (the G-D word primarily) to his opponents. I see no reason to unblock. The consensus of the couple arbitrators who looked at this was that this was something the community should handle, and the community has handled.   (',\n",
       "       '\"Saab lofton was a radio personality for about two months of his before loosing his show on digital radio network. He will not provide proof of his comic roofis (as in did he actuall draw it himself or did he contract out the work while writing the storie. Both of his books (pamplets) are home published and could be considered very racist! This is not someone that has any creditibily as he has lied several times on his wikipedia page.\\n\\nNo RESULTS!\\nOn June 12th, 2008 GLOBETREKER says:\\nThis is not an example and cannot be proven that YOU actually drew THE strip.\\n\\nLike I said I have been informed this comic in nothing more than 2 or 3 sheets of zerox paper stapled together. Not in the usual format as a printed affair. He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT!\\n\\nHe stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006\\n\\nhttp://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l\\n\\n“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. \\n\\n(Example #1 of his lies)\\n\\n2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.\\nThe first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing \"\"pamphlets\"\", sold out and was not reprinted.\\n\\n“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”\\n\\nWhen in reality\\n\\n“Lofton wrote \"\"A.D.\"\" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.\\n\\n(Example #2 of his lies)\\n\\nI ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!\\n\\n(Example #3 of his lies)\\n\\n“In all the WEEKS you\\'ve been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, \"\"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?\"\"”.\\n\\nI know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.\\n\\nAnd finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!\\n\\nHere’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!\\n\\nI\\'ve looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing \"\"pamphlets\"\", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as \"\"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair\"\". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don\\'t appear to establish notability either.\\n\\nTherefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can\\'t as I can\\'t create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk) \\n\\nI\\'ll keep an eye on it. I also find it a little hard to believe that he was kicked out of San Francisco State for writing a novel that was \"\"too radical.\"\" -) Steve Dufour (talk) \\nI went looking for sources, didn\\'t find any, agreed with proposed deletion. phoebe / (talk to me) \\n\\nYOU HAVE NO NO\\tILITY BECAUSE YOU MAKE YOUR SHIT UP!\\n\\n\"',\n",

       "       '\"\\n\\n:As near as I can tell, wikipedia has no article on \"\"cycle structure\"\". The cycle structure of an element g of a permutation group is the multi-set of sizes of orbits of the cyclic group generated by g. This is related to the cycle decomposition of g when g only has finite orbits, which takes orbit representatives a1, a2, ... and specifies g by (a1, a1^g, a1^(g^2), ... )(a2, a2^g, ...) where each tuple has no duplicate entries.

       "       '\"\\n==Merged with Pentateuch==\\nI merged this article with Pentateuch; there was nothing in the Pentateuch article that was not already in the Torah article, so there wasn\\'t much point in making the distinction. If the article were to be recreated, I would suggest that attempts be made to focus specifically on that term as opposed to the Torah.  \\n\\n== Dates and Wellhausen ==\\n\\nI think this edit  by  should be pulled, at least pending further consideration:\\n\\n:It must be noted that Wellhausen\\'s knowledge of Jewish literature outside of the Bible was limited, and led to his considerable confusion in event chronologies and dating. Notably he supposed the receiving of Torah was dating from about 1450 BCE, and that of monarchy, established by Saul, c.1020 BCE, and the (later) prophets, 9th to 5th centuries BCE.[ Julius Wellhausen ] In the case of the first the date in Jewish chronology is established as 1313 BCE, Saul is dated to 879 BCE, and Isaiah during 619 BCE. [pp.33,47,53, Kantor]\\n\\nThese dates are based on Seder Olam Rabbah.  But a literalist reading of that book would give the destruction of the Temple in 423 BCE   way after the accepted dates for eg the Battle of Marathon (490 BC) or Xerxes\\' invasion of Greece (480 BC); so a wholesale new chronology for the entire history of Classical Greece would have to be found  which nobody seriously believes is credible.  (See Missing years (Hebrew calendar).\\n\\nSo people who use the Seder Olam Rabbah dates (though not eg chabad.org ) generally adjust them to make the destruction of the temple match its date in the Babylonian records, viz. 586 BCE.  \\n\\nAdding that shift to Kantor\\'s dates gives 1476 BCE for the Exodus, 1043 BCE for Saul, and 782 BCE for Isaiah (compare Chronology of the Bible).  Modern views tend to revise the numbers down very slightly (see eg Kingdom of Judah).  So Wellhausen\\'s dates still match contemporary scholarship pretty much exactly.\\n\\nFurthermore, what is important for Wellhausen\\'s history is the relative dates of these events.  Even if one prefers not to add the absolute date shift, it makes no difference to the relative chronology of the events, and the relative dates between them.\\n\\nI don\\'t think therefore that this can be seen as a substantive objection to Wellhausen.    \\n\\n:I\\'m not sure I have ever seen Wellhousen mentioned to have been familiar with Seder Olam.\\n:You seem to be well versed, so I need not explain to you how Greek chronology is rather problematic in itself.\\n:What modern academics do with dates to support their individual hypothesis about record keeping in various ancient cultures is of course their province, but this particular subject, if it is to be consistent, can not be \"\"adjusted\"\" to match sources outside of its innate culture, or time, never mind that many academics who postulate the chronologies you suggest are neither Jewish, nor even monotheistic. \\n:I note that the Missing years (Hebrew calendar) completely lacks citations, so its hard to say who and how argues for \"\"the modern secular dating\"\". In any case, I will make sure to include a link to that article and will try to fix the citations in it.\\n:Chronology of the Bible article, besides being likewise poorly cited, has four other templates at the top {{confusing|date=June 2008}}{{disputed|date=June 2008}}{{refimprove|date=June 2008}}{{totally-disputed|date=June 2008}}{{Cleanup|date=April 2007}} however, I will get to that also eventually. \\n:This article is about the Torah. Textual criticism is really not the place for it given the volumes of published works on the subject, so I\\'d like to keep that short. My point with the dates was to illustrate that not all 19th century theories about the Torah were well founded.Meieimatai \\n\\n:The dates need not be \"\"scholarly\"\". They come from a source consistent with the method by which chronology has been established within the culture for which this text is held as the core source of social construct. I\\'d say that it has every right to adopt whatever dating it desires for its purposes. Lack of faith by the academic textual analysts is not required, however, deletion of what constitutes cultural me',\n",

       "       '\"\\n\\n== Land Day   /Jewish Exodus    ==\\n\\nThe background of the former is completely skewed, as you note. The latter article is premised on a wholly ideological POV attempt to establish a symmetry between the expulsion of Palestinians, and the far more, and much later (generally) exodus of Jewish communities from the Arab world. The Arabs did not encourage Palestinians to leave. Zionists strongly encouraged the Jewish diaspora in the Arab world to make aliyah. As it stands, of all I/P articles, the Jewish exodus registers as the one which narrates almost exclusively an Israeli/Zionist POV. Quite remarkable. This is how Shlomo Ben-Ami puts it, in his review of .\\n\\n::In October of that year, on the eve of Operation Hiram, which led to the expulsion of many of the Arabs of the northern Galilee region, Ben-Gurion declared, \"\"The Arabs of the Land of Israel have only one function left to them  to run away.\"\" And they did; panic-stricken, they fled in the face of massacres in Ein Zeitun and Eilabun, just as they had done in the wake of an earlier massacre in Deir Yassin. Operational orders, such as the instruction from Moshe Carmel, the Israeli commander of the northern front, \"\"to attack in order to conquer, to kill among the men, to destroy and burn the villages,\"\" were carved into the collective memory of the Palestinians, spawning hatred and resentment for generations. \\n\\n::There are only two points on which Morris\\' splendid analysis falters. He is unconvincing in his attempt to pardon some of Israel\\'s original sins by creating an awkward symmetry between the Palestinian refugee crisis and the forced emigration of 600,000 Jews from Arab countries and Iran, which Morris quotes Israeli leaders as calling \"\"an unplanned \\'exchange of population.\\'\"\" Regimes hostile to Israel were not alone in getting Jews to leave; envoys from the Mossad, Israel\\'s intelligence agency, and from the Jewish Agency were working underground in several Middle Eastern countries to encourage Jews to go to Israel. More important, for many Jews in the region, the very possibility of immigrating to Israel was the culmination of millenarian dreams. It represented the consummation of a quest to take part in Israel\\'s resurgence as a nation. No matter how painful the memory of their eviction or how humiliating their second-class status in Israel, these new Israelis never sought to return to their lands of origin. By contrast, the Palestinian refugees were forced into the wilderness of exile with no guarantee of a new national home and no prospect of returning to their native land. The yearning for return thus became the Palestinians\\' defining national ethos. \\nMorris\\' characterization of the conflict of 1948 as an Islamic jihad against Jewish-Western infidels in Palestine is also unpersuasive. It is true that the figurehead of Palestinian nationalism at the time was the fanatically religious and viscerally anti-Semitic mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini. And Arab discourse during 1948 was occasionally peppered with the rhetoric of holy war: the Syrian author Vadi\\'a Talhuq\\'s book A New Crusade in Palestine, published on the eve of the Arab invasion, compared the war to the liberation of Palestine from the crusaders. Yet Israel in 1948 was no tool of the West. On the contrary, it could not have won the war without arms shipments from the Soviet bloc. The socialist nature of Israeli society at the time prompted Egypt\\'s prime minister, Mahmud al-Nuqrashi, to define Israel as an agent of \"\"atheism and nihilist Communism.\"\" And the Zionists\\' Arab enemies were hardly under the control of Islamic movements. They were all ruled by decadent conservative elites who paid nothing more than lip service to Islamic values and the religious hysteria on the Arab street. Broadcasters and agitators rallied the masses under the banner of a holy war against the nascent Jewish state. But the Muslim Brotherhood sent only one battalion to fight in Palestine. It was ill-trained conventional armies, not Hezbollah-style guerrilla units, that led the Arab assault in 1948. After the defeat, rather than pursuing jihad against Israel, the conservative Arab regimes signed an armistice agreement granting legitimacy to Israel\\'s 1948 borders. And between 1949 and 1952, they all attempted to reach permanent peace agreements with the Jewish state.  Shlomo Ben-Ami A War to Start All Wars, Foreign Affairs, September/October 2008.

       "       '\"\\n\\n...\\n\\nThanks for the quick response Khoikhoi. I was quite impressed with how level headed your second reply to me was (you didn\\'t immediately go into a defensive ego trip like some others I\\'ve bumped into. Very much appreciated. A rare quality ). I will take your advice and will refrain from doing such edits temporarily. If possible though I still would like a little more clarification on the matter before I make any final decision on the matter. \\n\\nWhile there are occasional exceptions, a visit to virtually any article on any city in the world (new or old) doesn\\'t show the pattern of a long list of multiple old not in use historically insignificant foreign names on the first line. For instance FYROM/Republic of Macedonia\\'s title  lists Macedonian: Скопје, pronounced [ˈskopje], Albanian: Shkup, or Shkupi)[1] (their two largest demographics). There is no mention of older Turkish and ancient Greek pronouncement for Skopje).  So it seems very fishy to me that obscure Greek islands are seemingly being prioritized with old Turkish occupation names over major cities.\\n\\nAlso I would like to note the Wikipedia:Naming conventions (geographic names) specifically states \\n\\n::\"\"The title can be followed in the first line by a list of alternative names\"\"  (i.e. not \"\"must\"\" be) \\n\\nIt further clarifies the point (with regards to use  of older historical foreign names on the first line)...\\n\\n::Relevant foreign language names (one used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or is used by a group of people which used to inhabit this geographical place) are permitted and should be listed in alphabetic order of their respective languages, i.e., (Armenian name1, Belarusian name2, Czech name3). or (ar: name1, be: name2, cs: name3).\\n\\nUnless you can demonstrate that these obscure alternate foreign language name qualify as \"\"Relevant foreign language names used by at least 10% of sources in the English language or used by a group of people which used to inhabit the geographic place\"\"... I don\\'t believe an obscure set of Greek islands remotely qualifies for this rule of prominent display. And this point of sensitivity to names is further clarified at the head of the geographic naming convention article where it explicitly states...\\n\\n::Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.\\n\\nNotice the words \"\"and should be used in articles with caution\"\". I think it\\'s pretty clear that the Balkans are an extremely sensitive area with regards to names. (it stirs the pot for old ethnic conflicts)\\n\\nI think perhaps you\\'ve misunderstood my motivations here a bit. The issue for me wasn\\'t whether the names could be mentioned (they obviously always should be in there somewhere)... but exactly where in the article they are mentioned. Unless it is historically important (e.g. Constantinople) any mention of older historical Turkish or Greek occupation names should only be added later in the article in a historical or etymological context.... not be given equal airplay upfront with current names or historically unimportant names.  Doing so is both bulky and highly provocative to sensitive political regions. (and incidentally the same rule should apply for inappropriately using historically insignificant Greek names for Turkish cities)\\n  \\nI\\'m sticking to my guns that my edits were kosher according to existing Wikipedia geographic naming conventions and current widely observable conventions. I\\'d even go further and suggest leaving those old historically insignificant foreign names prominently displayed is far more disruptive than removing them (both in a Wikipedia sense and in a human toll sense) I therefore would like to once again remove those old names from the first paragraph but will delay pending your response to me (to confirm I have (or have not) convinced you of the accuracy of my assertions)\\n\\nThanks in advance for all your help. \"',\n",

I am not accusing her, I have disproved her already with facts. She has absolutely and completely supported and defended the William Travilla exhibition fraud which we exposed to the public as being a 100% criminal fraud. She edited out the facts on the William Travilla page, added links to her friend\\'s website, which is also a commercial website, Melinda Mason who sold copyright infringed DVD\\'s on eBay. \\n\\nNext stopthe VANITY FAIR hoax. Delicious Carbuncle started a Wikipedia page for Millington Conroy, after I exposed him for being a forger who fooled the magazine with his fakes.\\n\\nI am being blocked for telling the truth? Delicious Carbuncle is defaming me on her page, you did not see this?\\n\\nShe claims that her interest is not focused on Marilyn Monroe and or memorabilia? Her edits are telling a different story. \\nNext the Name of the Rose. She followed me twice now into that one. I was shooting 14 days for this movie and my part was \\'Jorge\\'s Novice and that was named after the monks, who most of them did not have a speaking part at all. Pauline Berry aka Delicious Carbuncle aka \\'Restawhile\\'  followed me to Wikipedia (since she has Internet stalked me for the past three yearssince she is financed by none other than Mark Roesler, one of the defendants in the biggest exhibition fraud in history.)\\nI am pointing out the facts here. \\n\\nShe is having a speedy deletion fest and she acts as if she is in charge of running the show. She is not. She cannot turn 100% costume fabrications into original Marilyn Monroe worn costumes, and she tried on her blogs to make sense, because she is part of the project and she is making money off of that fraud.\\n\\nNow you may think that this edit by Delicious Carbuncle is just \\'coincidence\\' or has nothing to do with Pauline Berry, but until we do not find out who truly is behind Delicious Carbuncle I would ask for fairness in this case and I am asking you to also block this person who has been publicly slandering me, with false accusations, with hypocrite statements and simply with lies.\\n\\nNow I am aware of the fact that they are working in high numbers, and that it is possible that you, blueboy are part of the group who are supporting a mean and sick fraud project which is out and created solely to defraud the paying public with some foolish fabrications.\\n\\nDelicious Carbuncle\\'s edit which is a message to Ernest W.

She is a 45 year old musician who also does try Marilyn Monroe imitations from time to time. She asked me years ago for my opinion as an expert on some Marilyn Monroe autographs and I gave he my honest opinion and told her right away that the signed photographs she claimed to have purchased were 100% fakes. She did not take that too well and ever since she is referring to me a \\'self proclaimed expert,\\' she has spent years now on her hateful postings, websites filled with character assassination attempts, comparing me to murderers Charles Manson and John Lennon killer Mark Chapman. Pauline Berry is supporting people who used AIDS infected blood within their intimidation emails and threats. Who threatened to come to my home and burglarize me, harm me, tie me onto a chair and steal my collection. Pauline Berry has been a big part on the public defamation on three people.\\n\\nPlease read the edits of Delicious Carbuncle and see the message.

       "       '\"\\n\\n(2)  The Quackbuster manipulation of Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia: \\n\\nWikipedia is an odd thing.  It is made up of a so-called \"\"volunteer system.\"\"  Several years ago, a team of quackbusters infiltrated various levels of the Wikipedia operation, and are now entrenched in the middle, and lower, level volunteer management system.  If you try and put any positive information about advanced medicine, or the problems of US health care, on Wikipedia, or change false or misleading information the quackbusters have installed, you will fail.  You will be blocked from further \"\"editing\"\" and the pages of Wikipedia will now carry information about what a \"\"terrible person you are.\"\"  The only way to have ANY influence over what Wikipedia says about  subject is to approach them with a legal threat letter at the highest levels.  Nothing else works.  Even that has problems, for Wikipedia management operates on a financial shoestring, and apparently has no ability to police its own encyclopedia.  Unfortunately, people use the encyclopedia - and they get very bad information about health care.\\n\\nBelow is a paragraph from the editor’s section of Wikipedia.  The editor, here, is discussing the problem of the quackbuster slime, acting to control the information flow on Wikipedia - and what to do about it.  so you understand the abbreviation POV stand for Point of View, and NPOV stands for No Point of View, which Wikipedia wants.  The part in red is for emphasis. Read this:\\n\\nI guess it depends on what purpose the External Links section serves. Do the links have to serve the NPOV interests of the article or can the links section be a place where specific points-of-view can have a chance to be expressed? As it is now, the chiropractic link section is broken down into Advocacy and Critiques. I think that this warns the researcher that they are leaving the NPOV environment that Wikipedia tries to provide and will be entering a POV external site.\\n\\nIf these links are truly just linking to the page for marketing reasons and don\\'t serve a primary function of adding to the knowledge-base, I would then say to axe them. I haven\\'t checked every critical link, but they do seem to link to essays or research on pages that don\\'t directly try to sell you anything (other than their POV). If they are all offering the same POV with no really distinguishing differences, then they should be reduced in number.\\n\\nThe soapbox point is interesting. These are external links so it would seem that Wikipedia is not being directly exploited as a soapbox. However, the abundance of critical links could be seen as an attempt to present bias... using the amount of negative criticisms to invoke a negative POV about chiropractic. My solution up until now has been to add to the advocacy links to balance out the criticism. You can certainly try to delete the critical links and claim NPOV but I can almost guarantee you that you be quickly (and improperly) accused of \"\"vandalism\"\" by one of three specific chiroskeptics who police the chiropractic page all day long as far as I can tell. They love to throw \"\"vandalism\"\" accusations around - and usually are vastly overstating the matter. That being said, I have suggested a \"\"disarming\"\" strategy, where both sides would remove links in a balanced way, but my suggestion was met with silence.\\n\\nNow as far as the link farming goes. Yes, virtually all of the critical sites are linked together through the SkepticRing, Anti-Quackery Ring, Chiropractic Subluxated Ring and other ways fashioned specifically for the purpose of boosting Search Engine ranking. A lot of those sites are operated by Stephen Barrett and his buddy Sammy Homola - Chirobase.org, Quackwatch.org, and NCAHF. They\\'re three organizations all saying the same thing. What\\'s really slimy is that they state opinions then reference their sister-sites support to that opinion. A lot of the links are operated or moderated by Fyslee (one of the three chiroskepics users who regularly accuse people of vandalism for removing links to his sites). Check out his userpage to see which sites he operates and moderates for. These chiroskepitics are working together to actively employ search engine tricks such as artifically boosting Google ranking by adding external links to their sites all over Wikipedia. I have documented this. Their goal is for a researcher curious about chiropractic to encounter their anti-chiropractic sites first on a Google search. Given these organizations\\' objective, I can certainly understand why they would want to do this. Unfortunately, the tactics that they employ are objectionable to both Google and Wikipedia. Hopefully these organizations will get wise to the chiroskeptic ring and ban their sites.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure what to do in the meantime. One thing that I would like to suggest is that a website is linked to only once in the external links section. As',\n",

Leibnizian physics defined motion and therefore space as relational.\"\"  William E. Burns, historian, 2001\\n\\n\"\"Leibniz held that the Newtonian universe was imperfect because it occasionally requires God to intervene to prevent it from running down.\"\"  William E. Burns, historian, 2001\\n\\n\"\"Leibniz also attacked Newtonian physical ideas, including absolute space and time, [and] the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which he charged introduced an occult force....\"\"  William E. Burns, historian, 2001\\n\\n\"\"Like Huygens, Leibniz never accepted Newtonian gravitation.\"\"  Ezio Vailati, philosopher, 1997\\n\\n\"\"Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians.\"\"  John M. Keynes, economist, 1936\\n\\n\"\"An atom differs from the solar system by the fact that it is not gravitation that makes the electrons go round the nucleus, but electricity.\"\"  Bertrand Russell, physicist/philosopher, 1924\\n\\n\"\"...what is really wanted for a truly Natural Philosophy is a supplement to Newtonian mechanics, expressed in terms of the medium which he suspected and sought after but could not attain, and introducing the additional facts, chiefly electrical—especially the fact of variable inertia—discovered since his time…\"\"  Oliver J. Lodge, physicst, February 1921\\n\\n\"\"Magnetism is possessed by the whole mass of the earth and universe of heavenly bodies, and is an essence of known demonstration and laws. By adopting it we have the advantage over the gravity theory by the use of the polar relation to magnetism. A magnetic north pole presented to a magnetic south pole, or a south pole to a north pole, attracts, while a north pole to another north pole or a south pole to another repels. This gives to us a better reason than gravitation can for the elliptical orbit of the planets instead of the circular. It also gives us some light on the mystery of the tides, the philosophy of which the profoundest study has not solved. Certain facts are apparent; but for the explanation of the true theory such men as Laplace and Newton, and others more recent, have labored in vain.\"\"  C.H. Kilmer, historian, October 1915\\n\\n\"\"Since Newton announced his universal law of gravitation, scientists have accepted and educators taught it, and rarely has it been questioned. Occasionally one has the temerity to say that gravitation is a myth, an invented word to cover scientific ignorance.\"\"  C.H. Kilmer, historian, October 1915\\n\\n\"\"What we call mass would seem to be nothing but an appearance, and all inertia to be of electromagnetic origin.\"\"  Henri Poincaré, physicist, 1908\\n\\n\"\"...the great truth, accidentally revealed and experimentally confirmed, is fully recognized, that this planet, with all its appalling immensity, is to electric currents virtually no more than a small metal ball....\"\"  Nikola Tesla, physicist, 1904\\n\\n\"\"If we were to assert that we knew more of moving objects than this their last-mentioned, experimentally-given comportment with respect to the celestial bodies, we should render ourselves culpable of a falsity.\"\"  Ernst Mach, physicist, 1893\\n\\n\"\"...certain theoretical investigations ... appear to me to throw doubt on the utility of very minute gravitational observations.\"\"  George H. Darwin, physicist, 1882\\n\\n\"\"The long and constant persuasion that all the forces of nature are mutually dependent, having one common origin, or rather being different manifestations of one fundamental power, has often made me think on the possibility of establishing, by experiment, a connection between gravity and electricity …no terms could exaggerate the value of the relation they would establish.\\'\\'  Michael Faraday, physicist, 1865\\n\\n\"\"Thus, thinking as Newton did (i.e., that all celestial bodies are attracted to the sun and move through empty space), it is extremely improbable that the six planets would move as they do.\"\"  Pierre L.

I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume \"\"Good Faith\"\" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume \"\"good faith\"\" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.\\nI was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don\\'t especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.\\nI have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.\\nThin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not \"\"assuming good faith\"\" or \"\"positively contributing to the consensus\"\". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for \"\"Making a point instead of wanting to edit\"\". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the \"\"TALK\"\" page says no writing will be allowed that involves \"\"general discussion\"\" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts.

In the front matter, Janet Marlow claims that \"\"Narciso Yepes [...] heard that there were four tones with less sustain due to missing sympathetic resonance on the six-string guitar\"\". In truth, Narciso Yepes always, verifiably stated that there are eight notes (from the twelve that make the chromatic octave) that do not have string resonance (i.e. a sympathetic response from an adjacent string). This can be verified in practically any of his various articles and interviews as well as in his Speech of Ingression into the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando delivered on 30 April 1989: \"\"The strings that I have added incorporate all the natural resonance that the instrument lacked in eight of the twelve notes of the equal tempered scale.\"\" That is not only on six-string guitars. Also ten-string guitars that do not have the specific tuning invented by Yepes cannot lay claim to having unison sympathetic string resonances for all the twelve notes in all positions on the treble strings. This is an indisputable fact of acoustics, a science, which as such cannot be fudged.\\n\\n2. Marlow does not define the term \"\"resonance\"\", which is used in this book in the lay sense rather than in its acoustic/scientific sense. This is evident from the chapter on \"\"Controlling Resonance\"\" in which controlling \"\"resonance\"\" is equated with a vibrating bass string that has been actively plucked. In fact, this is not string resonance, but simply a vibrating string. Resonance is the tendency of a system (like a string) to vibrate sympathetically at a particular natural frequency in response to energy induced at that frequency (that is, on another string). \\n\\n3. No adequate explanation of how this resonance actually functions is offered anywhere in this book. In fact, the singular tuning that adds all eight missing resonances is relegated to an aside comment in parenthesis. In addition, it is claimed that the author\\'s \"\"own\"\" method of tuning \"\"satisfies the needed sustain\"\" (Preface). As a fact of acoustics, the author\\'s tuning system does not provide sympathetic string resonance for all the notes of a chromatic scale, nor does it thus equalize the sustain, resonance, timbre, or volume among the twelve notes of the octave (which is the entire primary purpose behind the invention of the modern 10-string guitar). The tuning system used in this method, for example, supplies no resonance for the notes of F-natural and B-flat, neither does it offer any resonance for C\\'s. \\n\\n4. In the Preface, Marlow claims that \"\"In my own process over twenty five years I have developed the tuning\"\" that forms the basis for this method. In fact, this method of tuning had already been fully developed by 1982, not \"\"over twenty five years\"\". Records of this are in the March 1982 edition of Guitar Player magazine, in an interview with Marlow by Allan Kozinn. Furthermore, this concept is therein attributed to Oscar Castro-Neves (March 1982: 20), not to Janet Marlow\\'s \"\"own process\"\". \\n\\n5. The transcriptions of baroque music (by Bach and Weiss) offered in this book are fraught with stylistic problems too numerous to list but for a few. For example, the ornaments (which are an integral part of baroque music) have been inexplicably omitted (eg. trills in bars 8 and 15 of the Weiss Courante). Furthermore, stylistically inappropriate melodic intervals have been introduced in the bass line. For example, in bars 1-3 of the Courante, instead of the smooth bass line moving by steps from A2 to G#2 [minor 2nd] to F#2 [major 2nd]) - as intended by Weiss in good baroque style - we find erratic leaps of an augmented octave [A2 to G#1] and a minor 7th [G#1 to F#2]. Where this descending line should be structurally mirrored in bars 36-38, we find again an erratic undermining of the formal and stylistic elements of the composition, simply to keep the bass notes on open strings. As such it seems rather insincere that the author lists \"\"the correct use of octaves and bass lines intended by the composer\"\" as a justification for using the 10-string guitar when this is clearly not the case in her own use of the instrument. Also, very little consideration seems to be shown for open basses ringing together where they should not, for example, the first three bass notes of the Courante all continue to ring together forming two dissonances (augmented octave and minor 7th) where the composer intends a clean line in the bass. That is, the bass line should be a melody, not a cacophany of dissonant harmonic intervals. (I refer also the the DVD version of this book, now discontinued, on which Marlow performs her transcription.) \\nNEW',\n",

But language is not logical (it is one of the flaws in I/P articles that no attention is paid to this, despite academic literature on the issue), but full of queered exceptions, where tone and use subvert comparisons rooted in a sense of parity. For example, just the fact that in standard usage, -phile is suffixed to a disyllabic term for a country (\\'Anglo\\'/\\'Franco\\'/\\'Sino\\'/\\'Russo\\'), whereas Israelo-, having three syllables, differs and creates a slight jarring difference from the norm, counts.

Steroids include phytosterols. Phytosterols are not derived from cholesterol otherwise all vegan people would be in deep trouble ). In general there is a tendency to write comments from a human perspective. Please remember that compounds are found throughout nature and span many living organisms. That said I removed the anonymous person\\'s comments that all steroids come from cholesterol, who he removed my previous comments on the HMG-CoA pathway. I added lanosterol and squalene instead.  Thanks.  \\n\\n== corticosteroid v. anabolic steroid ==\\n\\n\\nCanof steroid hormones that are genericly refered to as \"\"steroids\"\" by different groups (corticosteroids by doctors, anabolic by athletes), end of similarity.  The corticosteroids are actually catabolic, the opposite of anabolic. \\n\\n==removed section and reasons==\\n\\n\\tThe first “Steroid” was a product developed in the 1930’s to give much needed testostarone to people whose bodies did not produce enough on their own. It just so happens that testosterone helps build muscle at an alarming rate. Once Steroids were proven effective on animals, Germany used these steroids on soldiers in WWII. The Germans saw that their POW’s (Prisoners of War) were suffering from malnutrition, so they made the decision to treat them with steroids. The steroids helped prevent muscle loss, thus making them live longer. It wasn’t until the mid 1950’s where steroids were first used in professional sports. Many Russian and European weightlifters used these steroids to increase their game and dominate the sport of power lifting.\\n\\tThere are many types of Steroids, but the most common of them all is anabolic-androgenic.  Most athletes take this steroid for the good effects the anabolic part brings. Anabolic means increasing body tissue (mostly muscle). So when an athlete takes the steroid their muscles increase dramatically giving them an impressive amount of strength. The only bad effect this part brings is that it can increase your muscles so dramatically; it can cause the user to become more prone to injury. The androgenic portion of the steroid is the bad part. This part is highly related to the male hormone: testosterone. This increases facial hair, baldness, nervousness, bad breath, and much more. The doctors sometimes prescribe their patients steroids because of the androgenic part. Androgenic helps synthesize testosterone, giving much needed help to patients whose bodies do not produce enough on their own. Doctors however prescribe only about 4-10 mg a day, whereas an athlete may take up to 100mg a day. Steroids are still not safe even if you use it in small doses, unless your body is lacking testosterone. Athletes need to consider the dangers of Steroids and not just the increased muscle tissue.\\n\\tAs well as the many types of Steroids, they can also be taken a couple different ways. The most common way to take Steroids is through injection; this is when the user takes a liquid steroid out of a bottle and puts in a needle. The user then injects the needle directly in the skin, like a shot in the doctor’s office. This can be especially dangerous because many abusers do not use sterile needles. HIV and AIDS can be transmitted from a person that has the disease to a person who does not have it. The other way you take steroids is in a pill form through the mouth. This is used less then injection throughout the athletic world because they do not work as well. Injection works faster and is much more efficient then pills. Pills are chea',\n",
       "       '\" Note: I\\'ve put the debate at Talk:Yttrium in the next section so that lazy editors don\\'t\\n have to click the link to see what he is talking about.\\n\\n[edit] Periodic group\\nSurely the group 3 elements are Sc, Y , La, Ac? NOT Lu!! See, for example, long-form periodic table. Petergans (talk) \\n\\nBoth conventions are common and are often a source of debate. The group 3 element article tries to explain the story. Itub (talk)  \\nCommon? I\\'ve never seen it. Lu is a lanthanide in all the standard inorganic texts, Greenwood & Earnshaw, Cotton & Wilkinson, Housecroft & Sharpe, Shriver & Atkins ... The debate was concluded long ago. Petergans (talk)  \\nJust last month there was an article published in J. Chem. Ed. continuing the debate (advocating La and Ac in group 3), and it cites a few books and articles that follow the opposite convention. See [1]. There are also four letters about this topic in the same issue.[2] Itub (talk)  \\nUnbelievable! In 50 years as a chemist I have never, until yesterday, seen a periodic table with Lu anywhere other than in the lanthanide series. Web elements is a first for me and, as far as I\\'m concerned, just another example of nonsense on the web. IUPAC puts La under Y. There is no ambiguity about it, just that the lanthanide series convertionally starts with La and is usually written separately. Petergans (talk)  \\nThis is not nonsense on the Web. There have been many textbooks published since the 1980s that put Lu under Y (I can\\'t say whether they are the majority or the most influential). Just one example: Wulfsberg\\'s Inorganic Chemistry. Wulfberg explains his reasoning in a footnote. In this letter to JCE, the authors looked at 35 textbooks for what they call \"\"flyleaf periodic tables\"\". If you look at the figure in the letter, among the textbooks published since 1984, 7 put La under Y, 7 put Lu, and 2 put all 15 lanthanides like IUPAC. IUPAC\\'s table is ambiguous. It doesn\\'t put any specific element under Y; it puts all the lanthanides there! Itub (talk)  \\nI\\'m flabbergasted. I thought elements were put in the same group because they have the same electronic configuration. The trivalent ions of Sc, Y, La, Ac have a noble gas electronic configuration. Lu(III) does not. How can it be put in the same group? (Don\\'t answer that). I stand by the word nonsense!Petergans (talk)  \\nI\\'ll dare to answer despite your request. I\\'m relatively neutral on this issue because I think it is largely an arbitrary convention, but I enjoy playing devil\\'s advocate. 1) the periodic table predates knowledge of electronic configurations, and sometimes exceptions are made in the name of chemical properties (or even in the name of layout, in my opinion), such as putting helium above neon instead of above beryllium (although some tables do put He above Be!) 2) the relationship between the electronic configurations of Y and La is essentially the same as the one between Al and Ga: Al and Ga are both s2p1, but Ga has a full d shell that Al doesn\\'t have; Y and Lu are both s2d1, but Lu has a full f shell that Y doesn\\'t have. Trivalent Lu also has a noble gas configuration, in the sense of having no s and p electron in the valence shell, same as trivalent gallium. 3) if one looks at the neutral atom, La has the same configuration as Y, but that\\'s an anomaly in that it doesn\\'t follow the aufbau rule. But we don\\'t move elements such as copper and palladium to another group just because they happen to deviate from aufbau. Finally, one slight disadvantage of putting La under Y is that you end up with a discontinuous d block in the long form of the periodic table, which looks a bit odd in my opinion. Itub (talk)  \\n(no indent) The counter to that argument is that, in the spirit of Mendeleev, elements a grouped together because of similarities in chemistry. Therefore it is the electronic configuration in the \"\"group oxidation state\"\" that counts, not the configuration of the atoms. Cu is the classic example [Ar]4s13d10 in the atom, but in Cu(I) the relative energies of 4s and 3d are reversed and it is the s electron which is lost on oxidation of the metal, so Cu sits comfortably in a group with Ag and Au. For Au, the f electrons are discounted as they belong to the filled 4-shell comprising 4s, 4p, 4d and 4f.\\n\\nWe can argue this one for ever, but what concerns me now is that the basic image of the long-form periodic table, which is used in WP for all the elements, puts Sc and Y above Lu and presents La and Ac as a group on their own. I believe that this is misleading as it does not clearly distinguish the lanthanide and actinide series from the main-group elements and transition metals. long-form periodic ',\n",

If a Chamar, a leather-worker becomes a Sikh and receives \\'pahul\\' to-day, he at once joins the Ramdasias.

These men are called Ramdasia after Gui-u Ram Das, though what connection they have with him I have been unable to discover. Perhaps he was the first Guru to admit Chamars to the religion. Many, perhaps most of the Ramdasia Chamars have abandoned leather-work for the loom ; they do not eat carrion, and they occupy a much \\nhigher position than the Hindu Chamars, though they are not admitted to religious equality by the other Sikhs. The Ramdasia are often confused with the Raidiisi oi Rabdasi Chamars. The former are true Sikhs, and take the pdhul. The latter are Hindus, or if Sikhs, only Nanakpanthi Sikhs and do not take the pcikul ; and are followers of Bhagat Rav Das or Rab Das, himself a Chamar.

       "       '\"This comment is a classic straw man argument meant to misrepresent the side that wishes not to include the questions and answers to the test.  The author writes \"\"But we have to decide whether we believe in a society where most people are only allowed to know some few things that more enlightened heads decide are useful enough to them to justify any potential dangers and social problems they might create.\"\" Of course I and psychologists would agree that most people should not be forced to know only \"\"some few things!\"\"  The problem is that Mike Serfas provides a false misrepresentation of what the minority wants.  We do not want \"\" society where most people are only allowed to know some few things.\"\"  We want a very narrow and specific limitation - no cheat sheets (questions and answers) to tests that are used to help people. Other than test questions and answers the more encyclopedic information the better! Is that clear enough? We do not advocate that \"\"only psychologists know psychology\"\" as falsely claimed, only that test questions and test answers ought not be leaked.  It\\'s as simple and limited as that. Leaked questions and answers to psychology tests make articles on those tests no more encyclopedic than leaked questions and answers on the SAT or some other test would make articles on those subjects \"\"encyclopedic.\"\" A \"\"democratic sense of equality\"\" brought about by leaking  psych tests is no different than one for medical licensing exams (\"\"why shouldn\\'t everybody be able to practice medicine? let\\'s leak all the questions ans answers...\"\"), etc.  \\n\\nWhen you leak the test questions and test answers to a history test you rob that test of its purpose: to examine how well students have learned history.  A history teacher objecting to leaking this information does not wish that history remain a secret known only to him (on the contrary!).  He just wants to be able to tell how well his students have learned and it\\'s much harder for this to be done if he can\\'t use a test to do it.  Similarly, when you leak the questions and answers to a medical licensing exam, you rob that exam of its ability to test whether or not people are qualified to practice medicine. This makes it much harder to determine whether or not someone is qualified.  The purpose of the Rorschach is help the psychologist make accurate diagnoses in order to help people and society. Mr. Serfas\\' statement that \"\"is no consensus even among psychologists that the test is useful\"\" is absolutely false.  There is some controversy between a small group of psychologists led by James Wood and the majority over whether or not it is overused but even Wood, the Rorschach\\'s main opponent, states that the test is not worthless (see this article. This controversy can be adequately described (and ought to be) in the article without including the tests\\' \"\"cheat sheet\"\" (its questions and answers). Even Wood states that the Rorschach is good at detecting thought disorder. Thus, by posting its questions and answers it becomes more difficult to accurately diagnose thought disorder; a tool for doing so has ben compromised.  People might be given pills for it that they otherwise would not have been given, or conversely not be treated for something they have.  Most psychologists would welcome a lot of encyclopedic information about the Rorschach in the article.  It would be useful to dispell some of the scary myths about the tests, etc.  They object to including information about the test.  Just not the test\\'s questions and answers.      \\n\\nSo no, psychologists on this forum are not monsters lurking in lairs, or a secret society doing unknown and scary things which must be exposed, which is the picture you and others seem to be trying to paint. They\\'re just people defending a test used to help people which, like most tests, gets damaged if the questions and answers are leaked all over the internet. It\\'s rather difficult to engage in a dialogue when the other side misrepresents the minority position to such a huge degree, and then others vote or make decisions against this minority based on the misrepresentations rather than the actual position.  I hope that this has cleared things up for you and others.\\n\\nSome people have claimed that psychologists and others want to bring back the \"\"dark ages\"\" by not having questions and answers to tests on this page. I invite you to consider if maybe there is some of that going on on the other side?  There was a time when \"\"common sense\"\" indicated that it was ridiculous that people were descended from monkeys. The science, backed up by thousands of studies, is clear that the Rorschach works - but \"\"common sense\"\" tells some people unfamiliar with it that the idea that what is seen in inkblots can tell you something about that person is ridiculous. Or that some kind of \"\"magic\"\" is involved (scientists were once accused of witchcraft).',\n",

However, he was found to be in violation of the 3 revert rule, and to again quote the policy which ironically Malke was threatening people with and was himself found to be in violation of:\\n\\n\"\" A bright line exists on edit warring, known as the three-revert rule (3RR).

The subsequent complaints Malke made, and his promise to cease his activity in order to get unblocked a few days later, are a matter of record on his user talk page.  Malke has since deleted the notifications, but they are viewable in his talk page history, and make interesting reading.\\n\\nAfter Malke\\'s block on August 19, 2009, I decided I needed to take a step back.  For the past ten days I have busied myself with other Wikipedia subjects.  I now return to this page.  I suggest we talk a bit about what happened, and I also suggest we take a look at what happened here this month, edit by edit.  It continues to seem clear to me that Malke was editing with obsession towards an agenda; his obsession got him in hot water with the admins.  Soon, Wikipedia policy is going to change, as many here know.  I\\'d welcome some reasonable discussion, and renewed work on the article.   \\n\\nOn closer examination of the history pages of the main article, it appears some of Malke\\'s biased edits, through sheer volume, are still in effect.  I propose going through every edit of his, see exactly what changes of his have survived, and put back all relevant, sourced material.  Once that is effected, we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements.   \\n\\n:Having just returned to WP from an extended absence, I am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article, but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave WP more than a year ago. I recognize Malke\\'s concerns. Material that is added back should strictly follow WP:BLP, ie., it should be directly relevant to Rove, not defamatory, and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources.   \\n\\n::Malke\\'s concerns were one thing, his methods another.  Admins blocked him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule, but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material, and as the admins noted (to quote directly from Malke\\'s talk page history, since he has since, for obvious reasons, deleted all reference to his blocking):\\n\\n::{{unblock reviewed|1=I followed Wikipedia policy and removed unsourced material from the Karl Rove biography in accordance with WP rules.

Thank you.|decline=Actually, you removed several sourced sections, so that isn\\'t true.

These admins had not been involved here previously; they took firm, direct action on a disruptive editor, Malke, who was judged to be making \"\"untrue\"\" statements regarding his efforts.

       "       '\"\\n\\n:Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states \\'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time\\'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, \\'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.\\' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn\\'t claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, \\'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?\\' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real \"\"edit conflict\"\" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - \"\"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references.\"\" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it\\'s worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). \\'Everybody is entitled to their views\\', I said to myself, and moved on. I\\'ll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I\\'ve got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was \\'an advocate of \"\"Welsh nationality\"\" (which doesn\\'t exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: \\'Ignore it\\', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with \\'British\\' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru\\'s senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing \\'Welsh kingdoms\\' to the woefully incorrect and insulting \\'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales\\' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term \\'petty kingdom\\'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording \\'Ancient kingdoms of Wales\\', which is again quite simply incorrect (\\'medieval\\' is not \\'ancient\\'). Then I read his \"\"explanation\"\" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: \\'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!\\'). \\'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as \\'King of the Welsh\\' etc.)\\', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I\\'ve already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84\\'s decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the \\'history\\' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza8',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n\\nWith all due respect, the criticism section as it stands is a total mess. Setting aside the fact that it reads as if the year is 2001, an inordinate amount of text is devoted to a recitation of the Bovard article, which is A) a clear partisan attack piece (it begins with a snide and largely irrelevant attack on then-president Clinton\\'s character), B) a shoddy piece of opinion journalism overwrought with loaded assumptions (witness the dismissive tone about \"\"politically correct noncompetitive recreation\"\"), and C) dated. Did nobody else notice this thing is almost a decade old? Yet it is being used as the backbone for the longest subsection on an organization that is evolving, growing, and changing to this very day. Bovard *does* bring facts to the table but as it stands now they are sitting in a void of time and space. His article does not make it clear how statistically representative the examples of \"\"corruption\"\" were to Americorps as it functioned circa 1993-1999, let alone Americorps as it functions today.\\n\\nI am not an expert by any means on Wikipedia\\'s guidelines, I have never added or edited an article and it would not be appropriate for me to start here. But given this article\\'s immediate onslaught of criticism, I would have expected an ongoing narrative about whether any stuck (especially with the imminent arrival of a conservative presidency) and how (and why) Americorps changed throughout the Bush years, leading into its present growth. Instead what we are left with is the cluttered product of a single user\\'s anti-government tirade. I am not against noting that libertarians have a death wish for Americorps, but take, for instance, the section about Bovard\\'s \"\"unofficial source,\"\" who dismisses the reading program. From the beginning it was a rather questionable inclusion, but it is flatly contradicted by the study cited thereafter. Again, I\\'m no Wikipedia expert, but it seems to me an empirical measurement of reality should trump the anonymously-sourced attack from a pundit with a clear agenda. Why, then, is this whole exchange even necessary?\\n\\nEqually embarrassing is the sentence about GED students, who now apparently need to be stigmatized for no reason. The short \"\"Articles suggest...\"\" paragraph is only a little less disastrous; it presupposes that helping people get welfare is a bad thing, a judgment call which I think ought to be left to the reader. And even setting all that aside, why, from a journalistic point of view, does the above paragraph re-introduce the Bovard article? It disrupts the readability of this page, making it all the clearer that the criticism section comes from someone who is more concerned with piling one slanted attack after another than with writing an informative, cogent article. Narrative context is jettisoned in yet another paragraph (\"\"There have been a number of criticisms...\"\") which goes on to raise vague, weaselly arguments sourced by an article that returns a 404. The user above me has a raised a critique that I think is also fair about the last paragraph\\'s apparent opposition to the concept of self-esteem.\\n\\nIf I could make a suggestion (and given my lack of Wiki experience I freely welcome its rejection) this whole section, as well as the one above it, needs to be wiped clean. There is nothing wrong with noting that Americorps had some issues in the \\'90s, so long as this article leaves one able to discern that we are no longer living in the \\'90s. As it stands, the specific citations strike me as largely irrelevant cases of excess scrutinizing. The $20k+ cost to the taxpayer per volunteer is a valuable piece of information and should not be omitted from this article. It should also not be mentioned without reference to the benefits that Americorps volunteers provide. Contrary to the what the criticism section implies, it does not seem likely that tens of thousands of volunteers per year are being paid only to paint murals and put on puppet shows. If this means that Wiki editors have to conduct more contemporary research (the last 3-4 years seeming most appropriate) in order to determine just what services Americorps volunteers provide and who they affect, so be it. No doubt it would be even more difficult to assess how Americorps changes the lives and attitudes of its volunteers (and perhaps I am biased supposing from the onset that it creates more generous public services) but this, too, would be a benefit. Cite the cost, describe the benefits as neutrally as possible, and let the reader determine for himself whether the end result is \"\"efficient.\"\" And move on.   M32\"',\n",

       "       '\"\\n\\n:::(moved from  )\\nDai, ydych chi\\'n siarad Cymraeg? I love that language. I studied it a long time ago, but unfortunately I\\'ve forgotten most of it. Let\\'s see, what were you asking? If I have considered checking my edits? And you were informing me about the \"\"Show preview\"\" box? Ha-ha-ha! Very funny. Have you considered checking how long a user has been on Wikipedia and how many edits he\\'s made before asking that question? So, here is some information for you: , First edit: Apr 21, 2008, Unique articles edited: 533. , First edit: Jun 24, 2004, Unique articles edited: 1,461. As you can see, I\\'ve been on the Wikipedia for five and a half years. And, yes, I always use \"\"Show preview\"\" function.\\n\\nHowever, I did screw up when I undid your edit, because, when I compared the two versions, all I could see was the removal of the Union Jack . Of course, your Edit summary said \"\"Repair Wikilink, tidy\"\", so I suspected there was something else I wasn\\'t seeing, but, much as I stared, I could not see the link fix. (Needless to say, when I went back now, I saw it right away.)\\n\\nLook, if I could vote for Welsh independence tomorrow, I would do it. I\\'m all for it. Ditto for all the other unrepresented nationalities. But what I can\\'t stand is when people take their nationalistic battles to the Wikipedia. Is Wales one of the United Kingdom\\'s constituent countries, whether one likes it or not? I noticed you did not remove that part, so I must conclude you agree. But you chose to remove the flagicon and referred to that particular edit as \"\"tidy\"\"! (Again, very funny, not to mention a little tricky.) Well that flagicon is also shown next to England and Scotland in the List of country name etymologies, so in order to \"\"tidy\"\" up the whole article you should remove it in all three places! But you didn\\'t. Hence the inconsistency.\\n\\nFrankly, I don\\'t understand where you find the cheek to refer to my restoration of the previous status quo as \"\"removing edits I just don\\'t like\"\" and as a \"\"simple/simplistic knee-jerk response\"\". Are you kidding me? That is ridiculous and disingenuous. Now, having said that, let me join you in saying Cymru am byth!    \\n\\n:Hi Pasquale, ydw. Dw\\'n siarad Cymraeg, diolch. I\\'ve moved your reply here for two reasons. 1. to keep it in one place. 2. to remove the union flag from my talk page (and you call my edits tricky and disingenuous). Glad you enjoyed my joke. I note your failure to WP:AGF for my edit and your accusation of nationalistic bias. Let me talk you through my process: I had seen that an editor (turns out to have been you) had consolidated the Cymru and Wales entries, but had made an error in the process (the one I corrected). I noticed the union flag had been added - which had not been on the Cymru entry previously - and that other (non-sovereign) countries (visible from W down) do not have the flags of the sovereign states that govern them. e.g: Wake Island (territory of the United States of America)Wallis and Futuna (territory of France)Western Sahara (claimed by Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic)I went to the beginning of the article to check that other (non-sovereign) countries do not have the flags of the sovereign states that govern them either. e.g.: Åland (autonomous province of Finland):American Samoa (territory of the United States of America):Anguilla (overseas territory of the United Kingdom):Aruba (territory of Netherlands)Therefore, as far as I could tell (although I concede that I should have checked the entire article for British nationalist bias), additional, sovereign state flag icons were not used on the article, and the one on the Wales entry was therefore unnecessary, which is why I removed it - thus tidying the article. That is how I found \"\"the cheek to refer to [your] restoration of the previous status quo as \"\"removing edits [you] just don\\'t like\"\" and as a \"\"simple/simplistic knee-jerk response\"\".\"\" Which seems justified. It remains to be seen how you deal with the apparent inconsistency in the article. Hwyl,   \"',\n",

This is the same bio that is used by the university at which I am a professor.  In fact, I think thats how the edit may have gotten tagged as a copyright violation.  Nevertheless, this bio, which I wrote, does appear in various public forums so I hope that it doesnt present any problems.  Here is what I would like to say:\\n\\nAndy Brick is a prolific composer, conductor and symphonist.

       "       '\"\\n\\n== FAGS ==\\n\\nIt had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.\\n\\nHaving returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.\\n\\nAs I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine\\'s skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.\\n\\nThe conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth\\'s black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.\\n\\nIt felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.\\n\\nThe intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.\\n\\nNo words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.\\n\\nI awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it had been over a year since ',\n",

As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels.

       "       '\"\\n\\n== UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! ==\\n\\n\\n{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!\\n\\nIt had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.\\n\\nHaving returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.\\n\\nAs I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine\\'s skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.\\n\\nThe conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other.

       "       '\"\\n\\n::I\\'ve have, in the travels here on Wikipedia, stumbled across some accounts that had been banned, and in each case, the banning notice advise the banned of the lenght of time the ban would be in effect? If not improper, might I be told?\\n\\n::I edited a hidden note to clean it up and expand it in hopes it would then be better understood and accepted because, in the state it was in, it was jumbled and confusing (obviously, such things are IMO). Also, part of the message was put in a hidden note before the word in the principle article (“are”)  that was sought (by other before me) to be protected and to remain unchanged, and part of the hidden note’s message was put behind the word (“are”) in what is a separate hidden note, a factor I saw as being counter-productive, but concerning which I also had an idea in my mind as to why someone might want a word or two – but few words were best IMO  in the part before the word “are.”\\n\\n::Editor EscapeOrbit (the person I understand is claiming that he was threatened) now takes the position that that the hidden note that was edited was near perfect and doing a good job for the many weeks it had been there.EscapeOrbit, in his talk page comment of 14:42, 8 February 2010, wrote ’’”The facts are that this note has been on this article in one fashion or another for some while. . .I believe it is doing the job intended.”’’ http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Queen_(band)&diff;=next&oldid;=342616216  However, the same EscapeOrbit on January 20, 2010, on the talk page for Queen, said ‘’“The ‘were’/’are’ ‘’{please note: this is the same ‘are’ in the principal article mentioned in my paragraph above} ‘’in the lead  and dates in the info box get changed almost daily, and have done so for years.”’’ Please see the full entry in context in the footnotes, where you can see EscapeOrbit is saying this in response to another reader’s encouragement to improve the article so it can be nominated as a Good Article candidate.”I\\'ve put in this article for a peer review so that we can analyze what we need to do to improve it. In the next few days I intend to nominate this article as a \\'Good Article\\' candidate, however I feel ‘’’work still needs to be done.’’ I will be making ‘’’major improvements’’’ to the history segment of the article, I feel we also need to develop a Further Reading section and add a lot more citations throughout the article. ‘’’Any contributions, no matter how small, would be sincerely appreciated.’’’ Let\\'s do Freddie proud and get this to Featured Article status. TheStig \\nI fear you\\'ll not get very far with a GA nomination while there is still near constant edit warring over whether Queen still exist or not. ‘’’The \"\"were\"\"/\"\"are\"\" in the lead and dates in the info box get changed almost daily, and have done so for years.’’’ Is there no where we can get a definite answer that can be cited on this? Escape Orbit   {emphasis added} or the page itself if you prefer. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Queen_(band)#Nationality\\n\\n::The hidden message was, by EscapeOrbit’s own words, having no good effect. We had a written encouragement to improve the article so it could be submitted as a GA candidate (see footnotes). With my edit of 16:43, 7 February 2010,  I included this edit summary: ‘’“expand existing important note with new footnote, both to hopefully have it be more widely accepted, resulting in lesser need to keep reverting these same few words.’’http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Queen_(band)&diff;=342506929&oldid;=342389811 The “important note” I addressed in my edit summary is the hidden note concerning the “are.” The purpose, intent, and actual effect was an improvement in the hidden message.\\n\\n::EscapeOrbit’s reason for wanting the language he wants in the hidden note, in spite of the fact that it is not working at all to slow the daily changes to the words in the principle article that we actually both seek to have preserved, is that he personally identifies himself with the phraseology and is on a quest to be personally responsible for having (what are, in his opinion – and interestingly enough I don’t disagree here) British subject matters use British English. He writes about this phrasing, precious to him, that it is ‘’”It is similar to a note that ‘’’I frequently attach to British musical band\\'s articles” ‘’’ ’’ {emphasis added}. He is overly invested in defending the phrasing that by his own statement is not have a positive effect. The problem is that he has posted “frequently” and so, like a beloved child, even though he says it’s not working, he isn’t about to have anyone change his baby.\\n\\n::My changes to the hidden message are those words in bold: “are DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO IS OR WERE. \\'Are\\' is the correct UK ‘’’primary compulsory education reading level’’’ ',\n",

       "       '\"\\n\\n== Recent edits by dapi ==\\n\\nUser dapi did several edits which look for me kinda strange or even bias\\n\\n*the infobox\\n\\nsome weeks ago i created the infobox with good reliable data, mostly zetterling koltunov frieser. i created notes so that everyone can check\\nfast which units had how much men/tanks. this numbers were near perfect now dapi changed into the numbers of glantz, who seems to be a bit dubios\\n. glantz was earlier convicted for using russian extrem propaganda like rotmistrov, his books cited rotmistrov and used faked sources.\\n\\nwhat was changed? the infbox now has lower numbers for men, this is explained fast and easy. The menpower before was the so called Verpflegungsstärke\\n, iam missing the english word but this means the strengh was every listed personnel in this units so auxillary units were included. i decided to take\\nthis number becuse most articles use this number. but the russian number dropped by 900.000. this is explained easily too. glantz/dapi ( i dont know if glantz\\nreally uses this number ) didnt count the entire steppe front ^^ i explain this \"\"trick\"\" with tanks:\\n\\nthe tanks: we can see perfectly on the tanks. before dapis edit, the infbox showed 4.900 russian AFV but now only 3,155. i looked my sources and find\\n1,607 tanks for the central  1,699 voronez that makes 3,306( this is glantz numbers plus some tanks), this number is already higher than glantz \"\"numbers\"\" but now it comes, he totally forgot \\nthe steppefront\\nwith 1,632 tanks, the same steppefront which used many of his armies to support the southern wing. to exclude the steppefront is nothing less than russian bias and vandalizm\\n. during operaiton zitadelle the westernfront and the brijansk front started attacking the german units both fronts together fielded another 3,200 tanks lol . but this\\ntroops are no included. i dit not include this troops too because i was aware that this will be reverted but to be honest all participating russian fronts fielded\\n~8,000 tanks ^^( to compare please take zetterling who wrote a book about the numbers of kursk ) but glantz achieve a much lesser number with excluding entire fronts. alone rotmistrovs \\n5th Guards Tank Army fielded 800 tanks and attacked mansteins tropps^^.\\nso the russian numbers are simply selective, if a front took part or dont doesnt madder... .but why are the german tanks so high now?\\n\\nwhile glantz is excluding entire russian fronts he brings a strange number for german tanks, when i check the sources i found 3,534 tanks ( zetterling/frankson wrote a book only about \\nthe numbers behind kursk, frieser and the german ministry for militarystudy support with primary data) for the eastern front. glantz brings 3,155 tanks . lol . i dont know were this numbers \\ncame from but this would mean that the 3 german armies had 90% of all tanks in this 3 armies ( one is only armygroup ).\\nthis is bullshit we have a list for all german units and tanks, glantz number is wrong. the joke is while he excludes the entire steppe front brijansk and westernfront he dont excludes all\\nthe german reserves which werent used like the tankcorps around the 5th SS wiking this units werent used. but the used russian units are excluded . heavy bias.... . i can support my points with\\nsources . i would suggest dapi does the same and we discuss the book of glantz. please tell me what glantz says why he excludes the other fronts.... . to avoid such bias i created notes so that every\\nreader can click and see immediate which army/front had how much tanks, that was good i think....\\n\\ndapi comments his changes with \"\"removing unreliable ed\"\" []\\nhe calls frieser ( and the Militärgeschichtliche Forschungsamt Deutschland and his 5 co-autors ) zetterling/frankson ( they made a book only about the numbers of kursk ) and koltunov unreliable even\\nkrivosheev becomes \"\"dubios\"\" for user dapi [].\\nwhile he uses glantz who was punked by blatant propaganda[] and seems to fake numbers to support his fact\\nthat red army didnt need numerical superiority. a interesting example is that dapi uses glantz to cite 350 tank losses for prokhorovka ( the mythbattle) and the same book is used to cite 340 losses\\nfor the complete \"\"zitadellecampaign\"\" -) . here it must be noted that user dapi89 is a big fan of frieser, he is citing him always when talks about blitzkrieg and to revert edits on the blitzkrieg-\\npage. so his opinions is not straight...\\n\\n*other edits which elimanted every ',\n",
       "       '\"==Kolyma==\\nI came across the Kolyma article while checking out some facts presented in a Danish newspaper article and was surprised to see that it had been marked as lacking neutrality in view of assertations made about the Kolyma Gulag (without reliable references, etc.). As I believe it is extremely important to ensure that the story of the Gulag is presented properly, I have spent a few hours on this article. The main problem seems to be that the author is not too familiar with Wiki editing. So I have begun to straighten a few things out - in particular correct internal links to the authors cited, additional links to the outside world and some footnoting. It would be great if some of the experts on Russia and Russian (Soviet) history could chip in too.\\nThere has been a suggestion that the geographical page on Kolyma should be separated from the article on the Gulag. Sooner or later, I think we should do that but the immediate problem is one of establishing the authenticity of the current write-up.\\nI found it interesting that of all the Kolyma articles in other languages - and there are currently 16 (see http://bs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolima) - only two (French and Catalan) describe the Gulag. Poland has a special page on this.\\nI look forward to hearing from interested parties.\\n: Thank you for your effort in cleaning this up. I had several concerns about how these historical topics are reflected in the Wikipedia, in particular:\\n:* Gross inflation of casualty numbers (I think the current version is more or less ok for that)\\n:* Use of strong emotional terms to describe an encyclopedic subject, which is completely unacceptable in my opinion. List the numbers, the facts and let the reader do the math. There is a little bit of that left in the current version, but it\\'s probably ok now, too.\\n:* Biased representation of the camps as working only to destroy as many people as possible, and comparison to Nazi death camps. The goal of the Soviet system was to industrialize the country in 10 years (something that the Western countries covered in two centuries before that), and to prepare for the inevitable large-scale war against countless aggressors  Germany, the US, Japan, etc, each of whom has invaded Russia just two decades prior to that. To that end, the most important purpose of the camps was to build the industry that has later launched the man in space and up to this day is in the heart of modern Russia, and to manage to do so in complete isolation and with very few available resources, before getting attacked. The brutality of the methods is very regrettable, but should be mentioned in an objective article along with the actual productive goals of the program, and the benefits the country has reaped, although at a very, very high price.\\n:* Drawing most of the information from Solzh\\'s Gulag and dissidents\\' accounts, who most certainly should not monopolize the license for eternal truth. As I mentioned in the page\\'s discussion, eyewitness accounts are important, but not the only one and by far not the most objective source of info. If you record testimony of 227 inmates of Abu Ghraib or Guantánamo Bay, they will say that those places are hell on Earth, the most mercilessly terrorized, particularly sadistic and the most unimaginably cruel human-run organizations, and the whole US concentration camp system is \"\"evil\"\", as, they would probably claim, are the US themselves. This alone would not make a good article on Guantánamo Bay. \\n:* Furthermore, Solzh\\'s book was used as an ideological weapon against the 70\\'s and later Soviet Union to present even the second part of the 20th century in Russia as one endless deadly torture and gulag, which is, of course, a complete nonsense.\\n:Given that hysterical overestimation and bias are very common in the West when it comes to these topics, I long ago gave up on trying to thoroughly improve related pages, because every time it sparks an endless flame war with people who tell me about tens and hundreds of millions of fictional casualties, and then my edits get erased or lost in the never-ending stream of b.s. So now I only do minor corrections, and appreciate when people try to constructively research the topic. If the arguments I presented here would help you in your further editing, then good; if not, then Wikipedia will remain a place of hysterical hatred for anything Soviet, especially in comparison to much more mellow and well-researched Britannica and Encarta.  \\n::I appreciate these comments and will certainly bear them in mind for future editing.\\n\\n==Yolanda==\\nI\\'ve been trying to put something together on Yolanda of Vianden as she seems to be one of Luxembourg\\'s mor',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\nErnie Smith writes \\n\\nÆµ§œš¹ I attempted to address the question that you posed regarding other inaccuracies but at the behest of User Hoary I have been blocked by the Wikipedia administrators.  That said, you should carefully examine what I did in fact state regading the four ways that Baugh posits as being the Afrocentric proponent\\'s view on Ebonics.  I maintain that just because a writer happens to be Black or African American (Weddington, Baugh and Green for example) being Black does not make their postion on Ebonics Afrocentric.  What I stated was that; \"\"the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way.  That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.\"\"  I went on to state that \"\"In fact, a careful analysis of what Baugh posits as number (iii) reveals that this view is not Afrocentric at all.  That is, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English\"\" (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric.  The other three views, numbers (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric...\"\" \\n\\nÆµ§œš¹, if you re-read the quote above carefully you will see that are clearly in error regarding what I stated concerning Baughs number (ii).  So let me make it clear here. It is my view that the first phrse in number (ii)that reads; \"\"to refer to the languages of the African diaspora as a whole”, is definitely Afrocentric.  What I questioned was the second phrase or clause in number (ii) that reads; “or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language|English: either”.  I contend that this phrase contradicts the first phrase and is therefore and oxymoron.  The fact that Eurocentric writers attempt to filch, redfine and use the word Ebonics to \"\"refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language\"\" does not make this practice Afrocentric.\\n\\nTo User:DESiegel\\n\\nI am indeed very well aware that languages change over time. In fact I co-authored a book on the origin of the \"\"N\\' word and in that book I extensivly addressed how the meaning of the Kemetic (Egyptian)word NGR has changed.  In this book Shaba Shebaka and I systematically demonstrate that while all English language dictionaries posit the origin of the \\'N\\' word as being derived from the Latin word \\'niger\\' meaning \\'black\\', (See Ullaman, et.al. Third Latin Book (1930:51) the word \\'niger\\' is not originally a Latin word. (see America Heritage Dictionary (1976:1531) That is, while the word \\'niger\\' may have entered into the English langange from Latin, the empirical evidence is that the tri-consonant Mdw Ntr \\'NGR\\' is found in the ancient Kemetic (Egyptian) language thousnds of years before there is any record of a Latin civilization.  The empirical evidence is that the root word NGR was introduced to the Ayran or European people when they initially invaded and made contact with the Negroid people (NGRS) of ancient India around 2000-1000 BC. (See Wallbank and Taylor(1942:72,73)and Durant (1954:356).\\n\\nIn Sir E.A. Wallis Budge\\'s Egypitian Hieroglyphic Dictionary the words NGRS and NGGR can be found in hieroglyphs.  Budge provides the specific site where these hieroglyphs are located in Egypt today.  As defined by Budge the first word NGRS is the name of an ancient Kemetic or Egyptian God (Budge 1978:341).  The second word NGGR is the name of an ancient Kemitic or Egyptian Goddess (Budge 1978:398).  For the Wikipedia reader that may be concerned as to the relavence of this discussion of the \\'N\\' word to Ebonics I strongly urge the reader to examine the etymology and definition of the word \"\"ebony\"\" in any unabridged English language dictionary. The point being made is that there is a subtle linguistic diglossia being imposed that must to be challenged.  Einar Haugen states the point I am making thusly:  \"\"if we call the building-up of a language an Aufbau and the aphasic dismantling an Abbau, the bilinguals restructuring can be call an Umbau.  This is the goal of all the studies if bilingual interference: in what way has a language been rebuilt or umgebaut because of the coexistence with another language in the minds ofbilingual speakers?\"\"  Of course to those who view Ebonics as being a dialect of English the idea of \\'biligualism\\' when it comes to the languge of descendants of enslaved Niger-Congo Africans in diappora is unfathomable.        \\n\\nReferneces\\n\\nBudge Wallis E.A.

       "       '\"\\n\\n\\nErnie Smith writes Æµ§œš1\\n\\nÆµ§œš1, you state or pose as an interrogative; “So what you are saying is that OUSD was addressing \"\"Ebonics\"\" as being defined as i or ii, and specifically and overtly excluding iii.”  In reply sentence, I say, I am saying what I have said and I reiterate it here; \"\"the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way.  That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective”.   I have said and I reiterate it here; “... As defined by Robert Williams the word Ebonics posits an Afrocentric view relative the origin and historical development of the language of descendants of enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora. The view that the language of descendants enslaved Africans in America and throughout the diaspora is a dialect of English or some other European language is a non Afrocentric view and it has nothing to do with Ebonics”.   In other words Æµ§œš1, there are ‘proponents of Ebonics’ and are ‘anti-proponents of Ebonics’.  The proponents of Ebonics are those who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   The \\'anti-propronents of Ebonics\\' are those who do not use view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.  The parents of the children of African ancestry in the OUSD for which the OUSD Board passed the resolution in 1996 were parents who are ‘proponents of Ebonics’.  That is, they are parents who view and use the word Ebonics from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.   I have said and and I reiterate here;  “the OUSD Board\\'s December 18, 1996, resolution was not about children who speak African American Vernacular English, Black English or any other appellation that implies inherently that the English language is the home, native or primary language of the parents and children that were the specific basis for the Oakland Unified School Districts (OUSD) resolution.  The OUSD December 18, 1996 resolution was concerning children whose parents had identified their home, native or primary language as (1) \"\"Ebonics\"\", (2) \"\"Pan African Communication Behaviors\"\" and/or (3) \"\"African Language Systems\"\".  I say, Wikipedia article that posits the OUSD resolution was about African American Vernacular English is a outright lie.  \\n\\nYou state or pose as an interrogative Æµ§œš1; “So what you are saying is that OUSD was addressing \"\"Ebonics\"\" as being defined as i or ii, and specifically and overtly excluding iii.”  In reply, I say what I have said and I reiterate it here;  the view that Baugh posits as Afrocentric view number (iii) is not Afrocentric at all.  I have said and I reiterate here, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English\"\" (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric”.  I have said and I reiterate here, the other three views that Baugh posits as being the view of Afrocentric proponents of Ebonics, i.e., views  (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric.  Given that I did in fact include view number (iv) as an Afrocentric view I am at a loss to understand why you have excluded view number (iv) from what I have said concerning the OUSD resolution.   You should know that I\\'m suspicious of your having ommited view number (iv).  For view number (iv), i.e., the view that Ebonics “is the antonym of black English and is considered to be a language other than English\"\" (and thus a rejection of the notion of \"\"African American Vernacular English\"\" but nevertheless a term for what others term AAVE, viewed as an independent language and not a mere ethnolect)\"\" is what was expressly being supported in the OUSD resolution.    \\n\\nNow, with regards to your interroagative concerning whether the first paragraph of the OUSD Policy Statement  “could be interpreted as meaning that parents don\\'t have to endorse the controversial classification to accept the services offered”.  My reply is; the OUSD Policy Statement was explictly informing the hog maws and hot souce eating Negro parents in the OUSD who are uncomfortable with their Afrcian ancestry and do not or did not indentify their child’s or childern’s home, primary or native language as Ebonics or as an African language system that the resolution does not pertain to them.  The OUSD Policy Statement was explictly informing the hog maws and hot souce eating Negro parents in the OUSD are uncofortable with their Afrcian ancestry and do or did not indentify their childrens’ home, primary or native language as Ebonics or as an African language system that, if they believe their home, primary or native language is English, Non standard English, Black English or African American Vecaular English (i.e., the language slaves or dogs born in the master’s house) they can continue receiving the Special Education, Speech Pathology a',\n",

       "       '\"==Questionable punishment of D*98==\\nThe January 2010 block against User:Darryl98 was extremely harsh, IMHO, as being a 1-month block for a WP:3RR violation that was escalated by a more-experienced user who was well aware of goading people into a revert-war. Perhaps an 8-day block would have been more fair, with an attempt to discuss the situation during those 8 days, and possibly remove the block sooner than 8 days, after true consensus (that means a mutual agreement). Please understand that Wikipedia policies are actually much more fair, in writing, than the way some users (and admin users) misapply those policies: the typical block for WP:3RR is only a 24-hour block, not 1 month. In fact, per WP:Blocking_policy, use of excessive blocking is a violation due to the reasoning that new users will become highly irritated by excessive punishment. The idea of fair punishment isn\\'t just a matter of human decency, or common sense when trying to actually \"\"collaborate\"\" with other users, no, much more than those reasons, fair punishment is a stated policy issue. I think what needs to be added, to avoid excessive punishment, is to develop a type of \"\"Code of Hammurabi\"\" as a list of wiki-punishments for each situation, based on length of tenure, total edit-count, and repeat-offenses, so that the punishment does NOT just become a matter of \"\"lengthen the block so a user won\\'t come back soon to cause more trouble\"\". Meanwhile, rather than reducing future conflicts, excessive punishment poisons the Internet community with unhappy users who spread the word of how they were mistreated. Typically, users will not see unfairness as a few admins crossing the line and violating policies in a harsh manner, instead, a user victim is likely to \"\"blame Wikipedia\"\" for being a \"\"bad system\"\" that harrasses and abuses people. What needs to be emphasized, in discussions during a shorter block, is that some (many?) users (admins) violate policies, but this is not condoned, it\\'s just hard to enforce because a banned user can return using a social-networking site that has thousands of IP addresses and Wikipedia cannot easily stop them. Also, Wikipedia has very limited appeal processes, and so there is nothing, yet, as sophisticated as even the \"\"American notion of justice\"\" in Wikipedia: there are no trials by jury of informed peers (chosen at random). Instead, many issues are decided by \"\"dog pile\"\" groups, who collect around a common bias or mindset, as a sort of \"\"feeding frenzy\"\" or hive mind that sees a negative remark as a veiled attack against the hive, and many members of the hive must sink into \"\"sting mode\"\" to counter-attack a person who states angry remarks. Currently, Wikipedia likes people who are ultra-mild and don\\'t claim any Bill of Rights but simply beg to belong with the others. Hence, people from democratic republics come to Wikipedia and might demand their rights under the law, without realizing it is the Law of the Old West: be as nice as possible to avoid getting shot by other users/admins who are toting wiki-guns. Only some people think users have any rights to fair treatment, despite current WP policies that even require actions to be fair within those regulations. Perhaps WP needs to teach \"\"fairness classes\"\" to users who come from fascist countries or domineering parents: being fair and courteous is not a strong force of nature, but rather must be taught to users. - \\n:Wikid, I\\'m sure that you are well aware of why WP cannot tolerate the improper use of WP:Sockpuppets. Just as your socking as Wz777 had to be stopped, so did PilgrimRose\\'s socking as Darryl98. But blocks are not regarded as punishment, they are regarded as protection of WP from those who, like yourself, are having difficulty working within the rules. The indef block of a sockpuppet is applied equally to all such.   \\n* If you read that user\\'s larger prior talk-page revisions, you will see that the stated preference was to become named as \"\"Darryl98\"\" so I am respecting that request. In changing names, that user was not aware of how people can be goaded into a WP:3RR excess of revisions, and that escalation seemed to be the most serious of the policy violations. It is not a violation to have multiple usernames on Wikipedia. Plus, as an occasional user, it seemed that Darryl98 had spent extensive time to read the policies about WP:Sockpuppetry and properly explained each issue as it applied in the situation: no clear violation of puppets, but rather just being accused of \"\"nefarious\"\" intentions, which was noted as a violation of WP:AGF. Again, the largest disturbance was engaging in a WP:3RR violation, typically risking a 24-hour block, wh',\n",

Kautsky and other works/statements despite the fact that Robert Service, IET, and other scholarly and reliable sources state that he does;\\n\\n(d) it is claimed that the Russian word ‘’strakh’’ does not mean “terror” when:\\n\\ni. the Oxford Russian Dictionary says that it does;\\n\\nii. it is evident from the context that this is the case;\\n\\niii. any educated Russian speaker can confirm that strakh may mean “terror” depending on the context;\\n\\n(e) it is claimed that Marxism is “scientific” when in fact:\\n\\ni. Marx was not a scientist;\\n\\nii. Marx’s background was philosophy and law, not science;\\n\\niii. Marxism is not recognized as a science by the academic world;\\n\\niv. virtually every one of Marx’s predictions turned out to be wrong, as became increasingly apparent during his lifetime and incontrovertibly so after his death (R. Pipes, Communism: A Brief History, 2001, p. 15) from which it follows that Marxism does not qualify as a scientific system by any accepted standards;\\n\\nv. the evidence indicates that Marxism is closer to a religious sect than to science proper;\\n\\n(f) apologist literature is being quoted in a fraudulent attempt to whitewash Marxist terrorism, in effect turning the discussion into an advertisement for terrorism;\\n\\n(g) it is claimed that Marxist terrorism is not rooted in the Marxist theory of class struggle even though there are numerous sources showing that it is (please note that it is immaterial whether terrorism had already been justified in terms of a theory of class prior to Marx, the point being that it was advocated/practiced on the basis of Marxist class-struggle theories BY MARXISTS):\\n\\n“Karl Marx felt that terror was a necessary part of a revolutionary strategy” (Peter Galvert, “Theories of Terror in Urban Insurrections”, IET, p. 138);\\n\\n“Revolutionary terrorism has its roots in a political ideology, from the Marxist-Leninist thinking of the Left, to the fascists found on the Right” (Noemi Gal-Or, \"\"Revolutionary Terrorism\"\", IET, p. 203);\\n\\n“… perhaps the most important key to Stalin’s motivation lies in the realm of ideology.

       "       '\"\\n\\n== Christianity and its Polytheistic Attributes == \\n\\nHere are some credible, scholarly sources, as requested, for the statement about Christianity and how it is believed to be polytheistic. I request that editors maintain an impartial approach when dealing with Christianity-related articles and other religious articles. I further request that editors acknowledge the polytheistic elements of the Christian faith, the controversy around the issue, and that Christianity believed to be polytheistic by some. \\n\\n\\nIt says in the American Encyclopedia (an academic accredited work): \\n\\n\"\"The belief in the Oneness of God – as a theological movement – began at a very early stage in history, and in fact it preceded the belief in trinity by many decades. Christianity developed from Judaism, and Judaism firmly believes that there is one God. \\n\\nThe path that led from Jerusalem (the home of the first disciples of Christ) to Nicea (where it was decided in 325 CE that Christ was equal to God in essence and eternal nature) can hardly be described as a straight path. \\n\\nThe doctrine of trinity which was affirmed in the fourth century CE bears no resemblance to the original teachings of Christ concerning the nature of God. Au contraire, it is the opposite, a deviation from that teaching. Hence it developed in opposition to the belief in One God… (27/294)\"\" \\n\\n\\nWill Durant, in his The Story of Civilization says: \\n\\n\"\"When Christianity conquered Rome, the new religion (i.e., Christianity) was infused with the blood of the old idolatrous religion: the title of archbishop, worship for the great mother, and an innumerable number of lords who gave peace of mind and were like who exist in all places and cannot be detected with the senses. All of this came into Christianity as the blood of the mother comes into her child. \\n\\nThe civilized empire handed over power and administration to the papacy and the impact of the word replaced the impact of the sword. The preachers of the church started to assume positions of power. \\n\\nChristianity did not put an end to idolatry, rather it reinforced it. The Greek mind came back to life in a new form, in the doctrines and rituals of the church. The Greek rituals appeared in the rituals of the monastic saints. From Egypt came the idea of the holy trinity, the day of reckoning, eternal reward and punishment, and man’s eternal life in one of the other. From Egypt also came the worship of the mother and child, the mystical union with God, the union which led to Platonism and agnosticism, and the erasing of Christian doctrine. And from Persia came the belief in the return of the Messiah and his ruling the earth for 1000 years. \\n\\nDespite the element of atheism in the words of Durant, which is something that he is known for, and which is apparent in his claim that the idea of eternal reward or punishment came from the Egyptians, tracing the origins of deviant idolatry in Christianity is no longer a secret, and he is not the only one who has researched them. In his book Christianity and Idolatry, Robertson states that Mithraism, which is a religion of Persian origin, flourished in Persia approximately six centuries before the birth of Christ, and it reached Rome around the year 70 CE, where it spread throughout the Roman lands. Then it reached Britain and spread to a number of British cities. What concerns us here about this religion is that it says: \\n\\n-         That Mithras, after whom it is named, was an intermediary between God and man (for a similar doctrine in Christianity, see Acts 4:12).\\n\\n-         He was born in a cave or in a corner of the earth (cf. Luke 2:8)\\n\\n-         His birthday was December 25 (which is the day celebrated by the Christians as the day when Jesus was born)\\n\\n-         He had twelve disciples (cf. Matthew 10:1)\\n\\n-         He died to save the world (cf. I Corinthians 15:3)\\n\\n-         He was buried but he came back to life (cf. I Corinthians 15:4)\\n\\n-         He ascended to heaven in front of his disciples (cf. Acts 1:9)\\n\\n-         He was called “Saviour” (cf. Titus 2:13)\\n\\n-         Among his attributes is that he is like a peaceful lamb (cf. John 1:29)\\n\\n-         The “Divine supper” was held in his memory every year (cf. I Corinthians 11:23-25)\\n\\n-         One of his symbols was baptism\\n\\n-         Sunday was sacred to them \"\"\\n\\nThe French Orientalist Leon Joteh, is of the view that: \\n\\n\"\"The origin of the Christian trinity is to be found in Greek philosophy, specifically in the ideas of modern Platonism, which took the basis of the idea of trinity as a view of the Creator of the universe from Plato, then developed it to a great extent, so that the res',\n",

And the fact it was later retconned. —Preceding unsigned comment added by 74.108.143.82 (talk) \\n\\nThe Chameleon (Dmitri Smerdyakov) is a Marvel Comics supervillain, an enemy of Spider-Man. The Chameleon is a spy and master of disguise. Throughout his history, he has used a variety of traditional, high-tech and biologically enhanced ways to change his appearance, believably imitating almost anyone. He was also the ally, servant, and half-brother of fellow Spider-Man adversary Kraven the Hunter. His name is derived from the characters Dmitri and Smerdyakov from The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky.\\n\\nContents •1 Publication history ◦1.1 Novels •2 Fictional character biography •3 Powers and abilities •4 Other versions ◦4.1 Chameleon 2211 ◦4.2 Counter-Earth ◦4.3 Ultimate Chameleon ◦4.4 Marvel Action Hour: Iron Man •5 In other media ◦5.1 Television ■5.1.1 The Marvel Superheroes Show ■5.1.2 Spider-Man (1981) ■5.1.3 Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends ■5.1.4 Spider-Man: The Animated Series ■5.1.5 The Spectacular Spider-Man ◦5.2 Video Games •6 References •7 External links\\n\\n\\nPublication history Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he initially appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #1 (March 1963), and was the first member of Spider-Man\\'s vast rogues\\' gallery, based on issue publication date, excluding the burglar who murdered Ben Parker. (Supercharger was the first Spider-Man supervillain chronologically.[1])\\n\\n\\nNovels The Chameleon had a vital role in the Sinister Six novel series by Adam-Troy Castro, in which the Gentleman, a long-lived supervillain and member of the Machiavelli Club (a gathering of some of the world\\'s most sinister minds, including several non-Marvel characters) uses the new Sinister Six, of which the Chameleon is a member, as pawns in his schemes. Oddly enough, in this series he is referred to as Anatoly Smerdyakov. In the final novel in the series, Secret of the Sinister Six, the Gentleman betrays the villains and tries to escape; it is the Chameleon, to everybody\\'s surprise, who kills the Gentleman, shooting the old man while disguised as a limousine driver and assuming his identity, only to be attacked by Dr. Octopus, thinking him to be the real Gentleman. Marvel has officially stated that the Sinister Six novels lay outside of normal continuity; however, these events have more recently been referenced in the Marvel handbooks. The Chameleon also plays the role of villain in the novel Goblin\\'s Revenge. In this story, the Chameleon not only teams up with the murderous Carnage, but also attempts to drive Spider-Man insane by impersonating Norman Osborn (then thought to be dead and buried), and later trying to expose the web-slinger to a toxic chemical meant to destroy his mind.\\n\\n\\nFictional character biography The Chameleon was born a Russian citizen named Dmitri Smerdyakov. In his youth, he was a servant and half-brother to Kraven the Hunter, Sergei Kravinoff, and eventually became a minor associate to one Gustav Fiers. Although Dmitri and Sergei were friends, Sergei was often abusive to him, leading to a combination of admiration and resentment towards Kravinoff from Smerdyakov. Eventually, Smerdyakov emigrated to the United States of America. As he had made a talent for himself during his youth, impressing his brother by impersonating friends and neighbors, he assumed an even more impressive disguise: the identity of the Chameleon. During his first known criminal outing, he impersonated Spider-Man, though he was exposed and arrested. Shortly afterward, Kravinoff, now Kraven the Hunter, himself came to America, and the Chameleon set his old associate\\'s sights on Spider-Man.[2] Both men became long-time enemies of Spider-Man, part of his primary rogues\\' gallery. The Chameleon inspired Kraven the Hunter to begin hunting Spider-Man, inviting Kraven to dispose of the hero.[3] With Kraven, the Chameleon then battled Iron Man.[4] Chameleon then confronted the Hulk.[5] The Chameleon stole some paintings from an art exhibit, but was thwarted by Spider-Man.[6] The Chameleon disguised himself as Henry Pym, and robbed Pym\\'s laboratory for documents to combat Virus Nine.

       "       '\"\\n\\n== Why will Gwen Gale not read the sources? ==\\n\\nOn I posted a section on \"\"Talk: Death of Adolf Hitler\"\" titled “Random Questions” which started “I am not a scholar, I read Wiki but would not think of editing it. But I was disappointed in this article, and many points in the discussion, so I am asking some questions. Perhaps someone else will read and address them.” The section went on with several rethoritical questions, and ended with “As to sources, the last books I have read are The Murder of Adolph Hitler by Hugh Thomas (sort of shaky) and The Last Days of Hitler by Anton Joachimsthaler (English translation, I buy much of this).”\\n\\nGwen Gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator, because at  she replied with: ”As the article lead says,...This said, this talk page isn\\'t a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic, it\\'s meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. I say this because the article seems to already cover, with thorough citations, most if not all of what you\\'ve brought up...dodgy. Gwen Gale (talk)”\\n\\nBy this reply it appears that Gwen Gale is NOT FAMILIAR with the work of Joachimsthaler, who I have just referenced, and thinks that I am asking a personal question, not a rhetorical one. At that time I apologized, tried to explain myself, and restate my questions.\\n\\nAt  I posted” If I had read Kershaw\\'s Nemesis Chapter 17 note 156 and Epilogue note 1 I wouldn\\'t have wasted your time. You can\\'t get much clearer than that. Should be required reading. Perhaps someone else should read them, and possibly edit the article. Thank you for your time.99.41.251.5 (talk)”\\n\\nAt  I posted “I would like to direct people to the work of Ian Kershaw Hitler, 1939-1945: Nemesis ISBN 0393322521. Chapter 17 and the epilogue relate to this article. Please pay attention to his notes and sources. Be warned, his book Hitler: a Biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....The source Joachimsthaler is basically an English translation of a German\\'s analysis of 1950\\'s post-Soviet interviews of bunker survivors. The original transcripts must be available somewhere. There are many other bunker interviews, some with questionable intent, and not all agree. Wm5200 (talk)“\\n\\nSince those posts I have posted a huge amount on the talk page, virtually all of which Gwen Gale has disputed. Much of the material I have posted I have later deleted, often because I felt that the endless conflict between Gwen Gale and myself is counterproductive to the article.\\n\\nAnyone who is Wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. Was I sometimes rude and argumentative? Absolutely. Was I making legitimate points which related to the article? I thought so. Did I receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? I think not, but you judge.\\n\\nMy main point was that Joachimsthaler had reviewed the information, and had made a solid case for positions which Kershaw backed. I repeatedly begged anyone, especially Gwen Gale, to read Joachimsthaler and Kershaw, specifically, two footnotes, I even told the pages of the footnotes. Gwen Gale clearly had not read either source.\\n\\n I posted, under the heading “Question for Gwen Gale” , the following: ”I lost you, but I’m confused myself.

Dan, you are over three million people higher in the food chain, you must be “world class”.

       "       '\"\\n==Empty Sections==\\n* Should the empty sections in this biography just be removed?   \\n:Not really. If you notice, all of them are linked to articles that focus on every aspect of Pedro II\\'s life: from his birth until his death and even after (Legacy). Right now I am working on them. One (early years) has been raised to GA. Another one (decline and fall) is being reviewed and might become GA. Once all are written and are considered GA I will work on Pedro II\\'s article itself based on those focused articles. Of course if someone else wants to do that on my place, he or she can fell free to to it. Regards,   \\n\\n==National Assembly==\\nThe article contains at present 8 references to \"\"National Assembly\"\". No political body existed by that name in the Empire of Brazil. The Brazilian imperial parliament was called \"\"Assembléia Geral\"\" (General Assembly). The General Assembly was a bicameral legislature, comprising the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies (see Political Constitution of the Empire of Brazil, arts. 13 and 14). Accordingly, I propose that references to \"\"National Assembly\"\" should be changed to references the General Assembly. Wikipedia should not invent names for the political institutions of a country  .\\n\\n:When creating a section in an article\\'s talk page, you should do it at the bottom.\\n:The name \"\"Assembléia Geral\"\" can also be easily translated to National Assembly. There are authors who use \"\"Regulating Power\"\" but also \"\"Moderating Power\"\" in reference to \"\"Poder Moderador\"\" and sometimes is not the best to make a direct translation. The other articles about Brazilian imperial history also use the translation \"\"National Assembly\"\".   \\n\\n::I have found both \"\"National Assembly\"\" and \"\"General Assembly\"\" used in references. \"\"National Assembly\"\" seems to have a long history in 19th century English-language press and other accounts. I assume that \"\"National Assembly\"\" was used to distinguish this assembly from other types of assemblies (i.e., not the national legislature) for the benefit of their English-language audience. I have introduced the Portuguese title for the assembly at the points where it would first be seen by readers. Readers can decide the translation for themselves.    \\n\\n==Speech from the Throne paining==\\nIn the painting by Pedro Américo (called Speech from the Throne), the Emperor is portrayed not actually delivering the Speech, but standing, before seating on the Throne to deliver the speech. So I propose that the caption of the painting should not say that the emperor is portrayed \"\"delivering\"\" the Speech, but \"\"about to deliver\"\" it. However, given that prior edits on this point have generated confusion, I will post this proposal here and wait until tomorrow. If there is no objection then I\\'ll make the change. It seems to me that the editor Lecen had finally agreed that the use of \"\"delivering\"\" in the caption did not reflect the reality of the painting, but now another editor (Astynax) has again resorted to the use of that language when making an edit intended to reduce the size of the caption. I agree with Astynax that the mention \"\"in the opening of the General Assembly\"\", can be suppressed, but I submit that to return to the word \"\"delivering\"\" is misleading.   \\n\\n:One more time: when you create a section, you must do it at the BOTTOM of the talk page. There is no reason to be so precise about the caption of the image. It is not necessary to have him holding a piece of paper in the picture to have the right to write \"\"delivering\"\". What matter is that he was dressed in regalia due to the Speech of the Throne. That\\'s it. If there is a painting of a boy with a book opened but he is not reading it yet does not mean that we can not write its capiton as \"\"Boy studying\"\". If you do want to help Wikipedia, start writing other articles related to Brazilian imperial history. There are plenty that have few to no info. Also, the wording used on this article and several others related to it - tha are rated Good Articles - on Assembléia Geral is National Assembly. It can not be written \"\"General Assembly\"\" on a caption wh',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n== Non-Authority Professor Samuel Eliot Morison ==\\nTo some writers this marriage appears to be a great mystery. How could a foreign chartmaker [NOTE: suddenly he is a chartmaker and not the same \"\"LANERIO DE JANUA\"\" wool weaver of Genoa presented in the Raccolta document XXXXI from 1472, Morison, going against the documents promoted the wool-weaver to a chartmaker? ] of low birth who had been literally “on the beach” a few years before, marry into one of the noble families of the kingdom? Already about 25 years old when she caught young Christopher’s roving eye, her mother was glad enough to have no more convent bills to pay, and as son-in-law to secure an up-and-coming young man of gentlemanly manners, who asked for no dowry. ( Samuel Eliot Morison, Admiral of the Ocean Sea (Little, Brown, Boston, 1942).)\\nTHIS previous extract IS A FANTASY INVENTED By MORISON AND A BIG LIE- This is a fabrication by Morison written completely without any proof. Morison did not find anything related to FIlipa\\'s dowry AND the truth is that Filipa’s mother was NOT paying any “convent bills” because Filipa was so privilegded that she lived at the Monastery of Santos belonging to the elite Military Order of Santiago where she had ALL EXPENSES PAID, as a \"\"Comendadora\"\" just like her cousin ANA de MENDONÇA (King John II\\'s Mistress) and her aunt VIOLANTE NOGUEIRA (nanny of King John II\\'s aunts) and even participated in the management of the All-Saints \"\"Comendary\"\". Morison even invented that his “Colombo peasant” was an up-and-coming star, a prodigy as if the mother-in-law, Isabel Moniz, already knew in 1478, only 2 years after supposedly washing ashore penniless (and not able to speak Portuguese or even Italian) that the wool-weaver was going to be a famous STAR in 1493. FURTHERMORE: Filipa\\'s marriage in 1479 HAD to be AUTHORIZED by King John II who was MASTER of the Comendadoras of Santiago. Contrary to what Morison and his supporters of the wool-weaver tale wrote of this fantasy marriage, it was impossible for Filipa Moniz to have married a non-noble two-bit weaver the likes of that Genoese Colombo who had supposedly washed ashore only two years prior from parts unknown with no money, no education, no ship nor even a job in that closed high-class society of Portugal—a noble society so restricted that the Captain of Madeira actually arrested his brother\\'s noble widow for marrying a Nobleman below her station.(1) There is NO DOUBT that Filipa’s husband had to be her equal in social stature and not any wool-weaver. The whole tale invented by Morison of a peasant marrying a Noble Portuguese Captain’s daughter is a perfect example of how inaccurate have been the history books on the history of Admiral Cristóbal Colón.\\nThe motivations that bring an author to take such wild liberties with the truth are not intended to be dealt with in this book, however it is something that should alarm all readers because the established pattern had always been one of accepting the \"\"myth of the Genoese weaver\"\" and then twisting the known facts to fit into that tale while at the same time discarding important facts that deny a peasant birth for the discoverer..... Don Fernando Colón who wrote that his father was of noble lineage and not a peasant laborer form anywhere as others were: \"\"Falsely calling him a craftsman ... [as such the Admiral] would not have learned so many letters or sciences ... especially the four main sciences ... Astrology, Cosmography, Geometry and Navigation ... The admiral was a man of letters and of great experience, and did not spend time on things manual or on mechanical arts.(2) Today\\'s investigations and scientific research confirms that Don Fernando Colón was right and that his father could never have been the wool-weaver Colombo, or Pigeon but was instead a Kõlon, or Member of some special noble family.\"\"\\n (1) -«D.

That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? \\nMy last comment is in response to Chzz\\'s question about me making the \\'gay comment\\' statement.

I personally couldn\\'t smoke enough tobacco to stay awake sitting through 88 hours of those horror flicks.  To reference another BRIC country: a 2004-05 study showed 89% of all movies made in India contained depictions of \"\"tobacco use\"\" (almost always cigarettes).\\n\\n* Trying to remove from Wikipedia cannabis-related articles any information about possible Harm Reduction alternatives to hot burning overdose \"\"joint\"\" smoking such as one-hitters, kiseru, midwakh etc. \"\"joint\"\" and rolling papers are a handy Industry strategy to get children oriented to cigarette smoking.\\n\\n* Trying to delete information that could serve as a warning against mixing cannabis with tobacco (for example, an edit deleting a reference in the hashish article to an Australian Department of Health study indicating that that practice could lead to unintended nicotine addiction (which is of course what cigarette companies want it to do).\\n\\nThis may explain why, in May 2010, Mjpresson nominated the One-hitter (smoking) article for deletion (reason: \"\"It\\'s just a bad article.\"\") (vote: 4-1 for Keep).  By October 2010, after pictures of midwakh, kiseru etc. were added, the article ranked ninth in Category:Cannabis smoking with 1191 hits a day according to a rating survey.  This week, expecting to win the vote against Tokerdesigner at ANI, Mjpresson has deleted over 50% of the One-hitter (smoking) article, including pictures (all-important!) showing what a one-hitter is.\\n\\nAt ANI I have referenced the May 30, 2011 World Health Organization press release claiming that \"\"tobacco\"\" (mainly cigarette smoking of course) will kill 6 million human beings in 2011, and scheduled to rise at present rates to 8 million a year by 2030; so if Mjpresson says Tokerdesigner is a \"\"single-purpose editor\"\" at least you\\'ll understand why.\\n\\nSo again, congratulations for opposing putting a picture of a \"\"joint\"\" atop the [[Cannabis (smoking) article (especially without any warning that there may be tobacco mixed into it), but beware, you have doubtless attracted \"\"their\"\" attention and Big 2WackGo may be after you.\\n\\n* Note: beware of 3-R\\'s, i.e. by simply reverting mJ\\'S edit three times you may violate a WP rule aimed at preventing edit wars; better strategy is to change something, add something different with each edit, trying to improve things each time in the interest of a positive solution.  Mj is a stickler for following the rules and will get you for that.  Though I consider him a stooge of the world\\'s leading genocide-for-profit conspiracy I also recognize that Mj is talented and industrious and may do much good someday (after being \"\"forgiven on grounds of insanity\"\").\\n\\n* Try to find more pictures (make a JPG file and upload to Wiki Commons, I don\\'t have that technology yet) which show better what a one-hitter is (quarter-inch or 6-mm screened crater for 25-mg single servings, instead of 500 mg in a joint every time you want a smoke! avoiding heat shock and carbon monoxide and dopy \"\"stoner\"\" symptoms blamed on cannabis etc.)  Mj objects to the midwakh picture because it is traditionally used for tobacco, not cannabis, but he also deleted it from the one-hitter article where it was clearly described as used for tobacco.  The kiseru picture is a bit indistinct and doesn\\'t show how narrow the crater is.  The major fear of the tobacco industry, even more than cannabis legalization, is the de facto legalization of harm reduction utensils which eliminate the need for high-profit cigarette papers.

       "       '\"\\n\\n\\n\\n== Maba Diakhou Bâ ==\\n\\nI first came across the Maba Diakhou Bâ article when I was looking for articles relating to Senegambia.  Having read the view history section of the article, it was evident that it has been on display for quite a few years now.\\n\\nThe purpose of starting this discussion is to disagree with several aspects of the historical account being presented in the Maba Diakhou Bâ article, based on reliable secondary sources as stated in the notablity policy.  Although I have primary documents about the man Maba Diakhou Bâ, I will stick to secondary sources in line with Wiki\\'s policy.  Before I start to put forward my counter argument, I think a brief history is necessary for those who are not well familiar with the subject.  \\n\\nMaba was a Senegambian jihadist in the 19th century who spent years launching wars against non-Muslim Kingdoms in order to convert them to Islam.  As it will become clearer , you will find out that converting people to Islam was not his only objective for launching jihad.  In any case, he was partly responsible for the mass conversion of the Senegambian people particularly the Wolof people and other tribes in the 19th century.  This is very significant, because Senegambia which encompasses Senegal and The Gambia are predominantly Muslim countries.  The Muslim population are the descendants of those converted in masses in the 19th century many of whom by Maba Diakhou Bâ.  Islam being very strong in both Senegal and The Gambia especially with the advent of the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal, Maba Diakhou Bâ is given a saint like figure in both Senegal and The Gambia.  As such, no one dares to comment on the atrocities of Maba, his back handed dealings with the French and British administration during the colonial era, his enslavement of people whom he viewed as non-Muslims, his pillaging of lands etc.  Instead, the Muslim majority of Senegambia led by the Muslim brotherhoods of Senegal have fabricated his historical account and pass it off as facts that some historians have fallen for, but of course there are others who will not be duped and have examined the true facts and written it accordingly.  It is very important to point out here that, not all ordinary Senegambian Muslims feel this way.  Many of them try to go about their daily lives with little thought for these kind of things.  There are of course others who take the words of their religious leaders as scripture that is infallible even if ample evidence is presented to them.  In most cases, when I talk about the Senegambian Muslim masses, I am referring to the Senegambian Muslim establishment, who mingle in politics, control what historical or religious programmes are presented in the media etc.  These are the ones who control information and whose desire to is release the type of information they want others to know and believe.   Having said all that, I now address each of the inaccurate accounts presented in Maba\\'s article.  \\n\\nMaba was killed on the 18th July 1867 at the Battle of Fandane Thiouthiogne commonly known in Senegambian history as\\nThe Battle of Somb. He was killed by the Serer people led by their King Buur Sine Kumba Ndoffene Famak Joof when he thought he could go and launch his jihad against the Serer people as he had done with other non-Muslim tribes and kingdoms.  (Sources: Histoire du Sine-Saloum  by Alioune Sarr, and Essai sur l’histoire du Saloum et du rip by Abdou Bouri Bâ)\\n\\nThe article did not give us the exact date he died and in the \"\"Death and legacy\"\" heading, made a transitional error as to the year he died by putting \"\"1876\"\" instead of \"\"1867\"\". I will also address that section of the article later especially in relation to the first paragraph\\n\\nIn the first paragraph of this article, it says and I quote \"\"He became leader Almamy in Saloum\"\" and under the \"\"Resistance and Conquest\"\" heading,  (in other words resisting French colonialism as noted in the first paragraph of that heading) it states and I quote \\n\"\"While he eventually succeeded in overtaking the dynasty of Saloum, his movement never succeeded in Sine, (Kingdom of Sine) and much of Serer territory remained animist or Christian into the 20th century.\"\"\\n\\nFirst of all, Maba was nothing more than an Almamy in rebellion.  He was not a King with all the powers of a King and him overthrowing the Serer Dynasty of Saloum has not been accurately narrated in this article which I will delve in later.  Note also that in the last paragraph of the first heading, the article talks about how Maba founded Nioro du Rip, but it did not tell us in any part of the article how he founded it, just like in the whole article, important pieces of information has been',\n",
       "       '\"== Early Chicago computer club ==\\nHi, thanks for all your efforts!!!\\n\\nNot sure if you wanted me to answer via your talk page. \\n\\nAFAICR (made that up - As Far As I Can Remember) the Chicago computer club I was involved with was C.A.C.H.E., the Chicago Area Computer Hobbyists Exchange. \\n\\nI believe there was a meeting approx Apr \\'75, begun by Robert Swartz, who was lucky enough to be able to affort a \"\"Digital Systems\"\" original 8080 \"\"box\"\" - and the CP/M operating system.  \\n\\n(Digital Systems was right up the road from Gary Kildall (the CP/M guy)so they got together.  - One making a rugged box and the other the OS for it). \\n\\nThe \"\"hobby\"\" as I see it really took off with the MITS Altair on the cover of the January, 1975 issue of Popular Electronics. \\n\\n[Back to Chicago Club] SO one day reading Pop\\'tronics, I noticed a piece saying there had been a computer club in the Chicago area, naming the people who attended, and saying when the next one was.    As I recall it was Lloyd Smith (now my best friend) formerly of Dyer IN, and Bill Burther, Valparaiso IN (R.I.P.).  \\n\\nSO we rode together to that possibly 2nd, or perhaps 3rd meeting (? Sept 1975) and I was hooked. \\n\\nMY involvement with the club was to be an \"\"active participant\"\" in that for ex. I was sec\\'y for many years, wrote programs to maintain the mailing list, help with the newsletter, often whipping up a small newsletter myself when no one else helped (this was one of the events that led to the invention of the BBS).  I brought my system in to show, back when maybe one in 10 actually HAD a system. \\n\\nMy home system consisted of an Altair 8080, to which I had added a Selectric Typewriter and Dynastor FLYING HEAD disk drive (a whopping 256K, yes, KAY).   I had to (1) teach myself digital electronics; and (2) design and create the board to interface to these uniquely-mine peripherals (Ex: Type a char on the selectric (terminal) and watch what came in - on an oscilloscope) THEN program the altair to \"\"produce outputs that matched that timing\"\", learning that  gasp IBM put the parity bit at the opposite end of the word than most of the rest of the world!)\\n\\nMy machine also  once \"\"video\"\" became available (I skipped the \"\"TV Typewriter\"\" phase), a 16 x 64 display called a Processor Technology Video Display Module.  (and no coincidence, the BBS Randy Suess and I invented and I programmed, had a 16 x 64 size message limit at first). \\n\\nTHEN my world opened to assembler programming (not hand assembling or some other hack) when Processor Technology came out with a paper tape-distributed editor and 8080 assembler.  (I seem to recall it having 4 things, but don\\'t recall now.)\\n\\nI modified the PT Asm to run on cassette tapes (The \"\"Tarbell\"\" having become a standard) and called the combination of things the \"\"CACHE Cassette Operating System\"\" (CCOS) and several people in the club started writing assembler programs.  \\n\\nSO anyway, the club had a huge variety of machines represented - from the \"\"boards\"\" - Kim-1, ?? Trying to remember if the Apple-1 was a \"\"board\"\" - I think so and the little Sinclair \"\"pocket calculator\"\" sized ones from TI or with a TI chip.  \\n\\nWhen the Radio Shack computers came along, many of us pioneers thought \"\"this is the end of the hobby\"\".  What we meant was, for example (maybe an extreme example) - I could design and make my own boards, AND write the BIOS routines to run them, etc, and THAT was more the fun - so someone buying a \"\"built\"\" machine seemed kind of sad.  However, this is the march of time, and I\\'m sure the \"\"Hams\"\" (amateur radio enthusiasts) felt a bit the same way as more and more products came along making it easier and easier to \"\"talk over the air\"\"..   I eventually - and somewhat delinquently - adopted the PC, but by then had pretty much \"\"burned out\"\" programming as a hobby, and did not make a LOT of contributions in that area. \\n\\n____ END _____ of my thoughts on the club, is this what you were looking for?  \\n\\nJust to \"\"come to a better close\"\"  the fact I\\'d done my own HW meant incompatability, so I invented MODEM.ASM (named  and it stuck  Xmodem by Keith Peterson) to be able to \"\"beep\"\" things back and forth with friends; \\n\\nThen the BBS came about as ME thinking a dial-in system to gather articles for a newsletter, but Randy Suess suggested a club project would be \"\"by committee\"\" so just the two of us - him HW and me SW - did it, independently of the club.  — Preceding unsignedcomment added by   •   \\n ([[User tal',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n===Islamophobia article vs. Antisemitism article===\\nThe first section in the Islamophobia article dedicated to in-depth development of the concept...\\n\\nThe concept of Islamophobia has been criticized on several grounds.[24][25][26] Some critics argue that it is real, but is just another form of racism and does not require its own category,[27] while others argue that it is used to censor criticism, that its use threatens free speech,[25][28] or is used to silence issues relating to Muslim populations in Western countries.[29]\\n\\nNovelist Salman Rushdie and others signed a manifesto entitled Together facing the new totalitarianism in March 2006 which denounced Islamophobia as \"\"a wretched concept.\"\"[23] British academic Michael Burleigh argues that the term \\'spares anyone the need to examine what has gone wrong within [Europe\\'s Muslim] communities\\'.[29] Others, such as Edward Said, consider Islamophobia as it is evinced in Orientalism to be a \\'secret sharer\\' in a more general antisemitic Western tradition.[30][31][32] However, Daniel Pipes says that \"\"\\'Islamophobia\\' deceptively conflates two distinct phenomena: fear of Islam and fear of radical Islam.\"\"[33]\\n\\nThe concept of Islamophobia as formulated by Runnymede is criticized by professor Fred Halliday on several levels. He writes that the target of hostility in the modern era is not Islam and its tenets as much as it is Muslims and their actions, suggesting that a more accurate term would be \"\"Anti-Muslimism.\"\"[34] Poole responds by noting that many Islamophobic discourses attack what they perceive to be Islam\\'s tenets, while Miles and Brown write that Islamophobia is usually based upon negative stereotypes about Islam which are then translated into attacks on Muslims.[35][36] Halliday also states that strains and types of prejudice against Islam and Muslims vary across different nations and cultures, which is not recognized in the Runnymede analysis. Miles and Brown respond by arguing that \"\"the existence of different ‘Islamophobias’ does not invalidate the concept of Islamophobia any more than the existence of different racisms invalidates the concept of racism.\"\"[35] Halliday argues that the concept of Islamophobia unwittingly plays into the hands of extremists.[34]\\nBritish writer and academic Kenan Malik believes that the charge of Islamophobia confuses discrimination against Muslims with criticism of Islam, and that it is used to silence critics and Muslim reformers. He writes that the extent to which Muslims are more vulnerable to social exclusion and attacks than other groups is frequently and allows for a culture of victimhood, where all failings are attributed to Islamophobia. Islamophobia is not a form of racism, in his view, because Islam is a belief system.[37] This analysis is criticized by Inayat Bunglawala from the Muslim Council of Britain and Abdul Wahid from the Islamist group Hizb ut-Tahrir.[38] Bunglawala writes that Malik\\'s argument is limited to overt acts of violence against Muslims, without recognizing less overt forms of prejudice or discrimination. By ignoring non-violent examples of Islamophobia, Malik\\'s commentary \"\"makes a mockery of victims of prejudice by pretending they have not been discriminated against,\"\" according to Bunglawala.[38]\\n\\nIn the wake of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, a group of 12 writers signed a statement in the French weekly satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in March 2006, warning against the use of the term Islamophobia to prevent criticism of \"\"Islamic totalitarianism\"\". The novelist Salman Rushdie was among these signatories.[39] These views are shared by Dutch law professor Afshin Ellian.[40] Critics cite the case of British journalist Polly Toynbee, who was nominated in May 2003 for the title of \"\"Most Islamophobic Media Personality of the Year\"\" at the \\'Annual Islamophobia Awards\\' overseen by the Islamic Human Rights Commission, for claiming that Islam \"\"... imposes harsh regimes that deny the most basic human rights.\"\"[41]\\n\\nIn an article called \"\"Fighting Islamophobia: A Response to Critics\"\", Assistant Professor Deepa Kumar writes that the modern-day demonization of Arabs and Muslims by US politicians and others is racist and Islamophobic, and employed in support of an unjust war. About the public impact of this rhetoric, she says that \"\"One of the consequences of the relentless attacks on Islam and Muslims by politicians and the media is that Islamophobic sentiment is on the rise.\"\" She also chides some \"\"people on the left\"\" for using the same \"\"Islamophobic logic as the Bush regime\"\". She concludes with the statement \"\"At times like this, people of conscience need to organize and speak out against Islamophobia.\"\"[42]\\nJohann Hari of The Independent has criticized the use of the term by organizations like Islamophobia Watch, arguing that liberal Muslims interested in reform are le',\n",

Some of the blue-linked dates should be unlinked (those not containing both month and day, as per Wikipedia:Dates); apart from that, the links in the article are fine.  \\n\\n:::Whatev\\'s...;~) the idea of leaving many red links in is to give people an idea of articles which should probably be created, especially in a newly-created article. If they stay too long, &/or the article becomes long-of-tooth, then they should almost always be removed. Obviously, do as you feel best. I\\'m for sure not going to express too much care, not there...  \\n\\nThank-you for your comments. I\\'m not too worried now. I\\'ve run roughshod over people in the past, and I know how easy it is to do. At the moment I\\'m probably in danger of running roughshod over some of the people who claim to be Wiccan but have no initiatory lineage. Just as you don\\'t consider Co-Freemasons to be Freemasons, I don\\'t consider them to be Wiccan. The thing is, everyone editing here is doing so because there\\'s a subject that\\'s important to them, so there are bound to be disagreements. I feel like we\\'re all on the same side, though, ultimately: our goal is to establish truth (or rather the wikipedia equivalent, verifiability), regardless of how many of our preconceived opinions are sacrificed in the process.  \\n\\n== Freemasonry category stuff ==\\n\\nGrye - Just took a look at the stuff you have been doing on the Freemason/citation project (your proposed templates etc.) ... WOW.  Thanks for what was obviously a lot of hard work.  \\n\\n\\n\\n== FRS ==\\n\\nIf you\\'re adding the categories, you should add the postnominals, too: Sir Forname Surname, FRS. Thanks.  \\n:I thought about that, but 1)I\\'m burnt on this... & 2).. I\\'m burnt on this, worried about people whining, & figured that\\'d be easy to do from Category:Fellows of the Royal Society. maybe another time...;-)  \\n:Wait, what do you mean: at the top, by their name, or in the Cat: listing?  \\n\\n\\n\\n== Freimaurer32 ==\\n\\nI don\\'t watch the Obligations page, but the gist of the discussion was that we can\\'t ascertain the validity of what\\'s in Duncan, so if it\\'s missing for the moment, it\\'s really not a huge issue.  I don\\'t like that article because it\\'s not really an \"\"article\"\"; it\\'s just some nonsense to get a sort of OMG!!!! MASONIC SECRETZ!!!!!1111 reaction and push people\\'s buttons, as it doesn\\'t discuss so much as reproduce verbatim, and the only reason that article is not gone due to copyvio is because it\\'s almost 200 years out of date and not subject to copyright law.\\n\\nFurthermore, given the circumstances under which Hanuman Das left Wikipedia (an Arbcom case that also involved all his buddies who voted on the last Jahbulon AfD, funnily enough, including Frater Xyzzy), I\\'m not tempted to put much stock in an \"\"article\"\" like that, and if we can\\'t think of anything else to say about them other than to reproduce historical examples that have no modern',\n",

Lebanon, in a Jewish[8] working-class family. His last name was shortened from \"\"Chabenisky\"\" when his Russian grandparents landed on Ellis Island.[9] Cuban\\'s father Norton was an automobile upholsterer.[6][10][11] Cuban\\'s first step into the business world occurred at age 12, when he sold garbage bags to pay for a pair of expensive basketball shoes.[6][12] While in school, he held a variety of jobs, including bartender, disco dancing instructor, and party promoter. He paid for college by collecting and selling stamps, and once gained about $1,100 from starting a chain letter.[6]\\n\\nRather than attending high school for his senior year, Cuban enrolled as a full time student at the University of Pittsburgh. After one year at the University of Pittsburgh, he transferred to Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana and graduated in 1981 with a bachelor\\'s degree in business administration.[13]\\n\\n[edit] FamilyIn September 2002, Cuban married Tiffany Stewart, an advertising executive, in Barbados,[14] with a wedding reception at the American Airlines Center. Their first daughter, Alexis Sofia, was born on September 25, 2005; their second daughter, Alyssa, was born in 2007.[15] Tiffany and Mark also have a son born in early 2010.[2] The family lives in the Preston Hollow area of Dallas, in a 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) mansion.[16]\\n\\n[edit] Early careerIn 1982, Cuban moved to Dallas, Texas. Cuban first found work as a bartender,[17][18] then as a salesperson for Your Business Software, one of the first PC software retailers in Dallas. He was terminated less than a year later, after meeting with a client to procure new business instead of opening the store.[19]\\n\\nCuban started a company, MicroSolutions, with support from his previous customers from Your Business Software. MicroSolutions was initially a system integrator and software reseller. The company was an early proponent of technologies such as Carbon Copy, Lotus Notes, and CompuServe.[20] One of the company\\'s largest clients was Perot Systems.[21] In 1990, Cuban sold MicroSolutions to CompuServe—then a subsidiary of H&R; Block—for $6 million.[22] He retained approximately $2 million after taxes on the deal.[23]\\n\\nIn 1995, Cuban and fellow Indiana University alumnus Todd Wagner started Audionet, combining their mutual interest in college basketball and webcasting. With a single server and an ISDN line,[24] Audionet became Broadcast.com in 1998. By 1999, Broadcast.com had grown to 330 employees and $13.5 million in revenue for the second quarter.[25] In 1999, during the dot com boom, Broadcast.com was acquired by Yahoo! for $5.9 billion in Yahoo! stock.[26]\\n\\n[edit] Business careerAfter the sale of Broadcast.com, Cuban diversified his wealth to avoid exposure to a market crash.[27] As of 2011, Cuban is No. 459 on Forbes\\' list of \"\"World\\'s Richest People\"\", with a net worth of $2.5 billion.[28] The Guinness Book of Records credits Cuban with the \"\"largest single e-commerce transaction\"\", after he paid $40 ',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n== Not impressed by the generic explanation when you removed my link twice. ==\\n\\n\\nWalter, \\n\\nI see that you are a fellow Christian and a fellow Christian musician, although being 12 years younger than I, it\\'s not likely that you lived through the early days of the \"\"Jesus Movement\"\" as I did.  \\n\\nAs a longtime Web Site content developer, K-12 Textbook editor, English Professor, Bible teacher, Music teacher, professional writer, and a one-time \"\"Jesus Musician,\"\" I\\'ve recently started a project (SchoolOfTheRock.com) to help disciple the 18-15-year olds I minister to regularly on issues of contemporary Christian living, especially in areas related to worship and Bible teaching.  Despite an ad here or there on the site to help pay a fraction of the site\\'s expenses, you\\'d be hard-pressed to call it a commercial endeavor. (I pay the site\\'s manifold expenses as a \"\"write-off\"\" from my professional consulting business.)  \\n\\nBecause I grew up with people who hate Contemporary Christian music (and still run into them from time to time), I thought it would be nice to include articles that show some of the ways in which Biblical living, and Biblical worship through contemporary musical forms tie together.  \\n\\nTo find links I could include from my pages, I went looking for any internet articles that provided insightful, balanced, detailed, and fact-based accounts of the history of Contemporary Christian music.  I didn\\'t find any that fulfilled all of those qualificatiosn.  Your Wikipedia summary IS useful, and is a good introduction, VERY appropriate for Wikipedia, but I wanted something that presented more details and presented them in a stronger narrative that showed the history of Christian music from the musician\\'s perspective.  \\n\\nSo I wrote an fact-based, detailed, well-organized article that included, not only the history of the industry, but also personal experiences as well as the experiences of friends who were either touring artists or industry professionals. \\n\\nYou might be put off by a couple of paragraphs in first person, but if you\\'ve ever read Paul Baker\\'s books, you\\'ll find all the proof you need that it\\'s an accurate history, even to the minor details.\\n\\nOr maybe you\\'re put off by some of the \"\"negative\"\" statements about dark times in the history of Christian music.  But the sources you cite and books you recommend have sections that are FAR more negative.  Also, I carefully chose details that would get the point across with inspiring the reader to outrage on certain topics, as a fully-detailed account would have done.\\n\\nI\\'ve also \"\"vetted\"\" the article for content, balance, and tone by running it past former touring artists and Christian broadcasting professionals who lived through the same era. I have gotten nothing but enthusiastic response.  \\n\\nIf you can find another Internet-published article (or ten) on the same subject that is as well written, organized, balanced, and fact-based as my article, please let me know.  I\\'d be VERY glad to link to them from my web site.  I\\'d also like to know why you don\\'t link to those articles from the Wiki article?  If they exist, that is.\\n\\nFinally, I confess that I am at a loss as to why you consider my article either to be a \"\"commercial advertisement\"\" or a \"\"personal blog\"\" (both accusations came through the message to me, though it was largely \"\"boilerplate,\"\" so I\\'m not sure which part was really yours).  I recognize that is is NOT a Wikipedia article, but it is a fact-based, detailed, and hopefully balanced article nonetheless, far more so than quite a few other article links I see on similar Wikipedia pages. It is not advertising any specific product, or even any commercial web site.  BTW CCM magazine is commercial - they cost money to subscribe to and have LOADS of advertising.  Why do you have THEIR link, if you are seeking to avoid even the appearance of supportiing a commercial enterprise.\\n\\nAlso, the article dos NOT contain unverifiable personal ramblings or rants, as a blog would.  (I publish blogs in other web sites so I know the difference.) \\n\\nPerhaps you object to the fact that I posted the link myself.  Would it be a better article if I asked an industry contact to post the link?  Or maybe you should read the article yourself and let me know specifically what you feel is unsuitable about it?\\n\\nIf you\\'ve lost the link, it\\'s at:  http://www.schooloftherock.com/html/a_brief_history_of_contemporar.html\\n\\nFrankly, I\\'m hoping that as a fellow musician you find the article edifying, exhorting, and comforting.  And if you ARE aware of anything \"\"wrong\"\" with it on any level, please let me know, because I strive for proessionalism.\\n\\nSorry for the VERY long comment, and God bless, \\nPaul Race\\n \\n\\n[[Special:Contributions/198.134.2.62|198',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n*OPPOSE For reasons outlined below I would rather have this article named \"\"Japanese saddle\"\" than \"\"Kura (saddle) if it comes to that.\\n\"\"Consensus is determined by the quality of the arguments given on the various sides of an issue, as viewed through the lens of Wikipedia policy.\"\" Wikipedia:Consensus \\n**\"\"Wikipedia has many rules. Instead of following every rule, it is acceptable to use common sense as you go about editing. Being too wrapped up in rules can cause loss of perspective, so there are times when it is better to ignore a rule. Even if a contribution \"\"violates\"\" the precise wording of a rule, it might still be a good contribution. Similarly, just because something is not forbidden in a written document, or is even explicitly permitted, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s a good idea in the given situation. The principle of the rules is more important than the letter. Editors must use their best judgment. Why isn\\'t \"\"use common sense\"\" an official policy? It doesn\\'t need to be; as a fundamental principle, it is above any policy.Wikipedia:What \"\"Ignore all rules\"\" means\\n**A little history on this article. Before creating this article I first uploaded images and created categories that relate to this article on Wiki commons under this category \"\"Category:Kura (Japanese saddle)\"\" [Kura_(Japanese_saddle)], this was over one year ago. There has been no objections to the title on Wiki commons.  When I originally named this article I did read the article naming guidelines contained in Wikipedia:Article titles, here are a few quotes from the naming guidelines:(it is sometimes necessary to add distinguishing information, often in the form of a description in brackets after the name.), I did this,  (The choice of article titles should put the interests of readers before those of editors, and those of a general audience before those of specialists.) It seems to me that only a \"\"specialist\"\" would understand what type of saddle a \"\"kura\"\" was, so when I named this article I looked at the list of saddle articles which are now in the category \"\"Saddles by type\"\" and here were saddle articles with titles such as English saddle, Western saddle and Australian Stock Saddle. Looking at these other saddle article titles I decided that Kura (Japanese saddle) would be the best title for this article as anyone who looked at the other articles on saddles could easily and instantly identify what type of saddle the article was about, if I had named the article Kura (saddle) it would not be a descriptive as the other saddle articles and someone with no knowledge of the subject would have to actually click on the title to see what a \"\"Kura\"\" was, with the word \"\"Japanese\"\" added a reader could instantly identify what type of saddle a \"\"Kura\"\" was, much like a reader who saw Australian Stock Saddle, Western saddle or English saddle would have a good idea what that article was about.\\n**I have seen \"\"precision\"\" mentioned, I do not understand how having the title as Kura (Japanese saddle) compared to Kura (saddle) goes against any of the guidelines in the section labeled \"\"Precision and disambiguation\"\", WP:PRECISION, if I had named the article \"\"Kura (the saddle of Japan) I would understand but how does Kura (Japanese saddle) go against any naming guidelines, how different is Kura (Japanese saddle) than Australian Stock Saddle? The only difference is some brackets. Here is a quote \"\"Precision – Titles usually use names and terms that are precise (see below), but only as precise as necessary to identify the topic of the article unambiguously.\"\" WP:NAMINGCRITERIA, the title \"\"Kura (saddle) not \"\"precise\"\" as it does not actually identify what type of saddle this is to the \"\"general reader\"\", I would rather have the article named \"\"Japanese saddle\"\" than \"\"Kura (saddle) so that anyone will know instantly what type of saddle this article is about if it is necessary to change the articles title, at least the \"\"general reader\"\" would be able to know what the article is about without having to click on the title as they would with Kura (saddle).    \"',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n== Comment ==\\n\\nMy comments on Malleus\\' talk page were well beyond civil, even for a user talk page. They were a personal attack, and warranted serious sanction. \\n\\nFor the record, it was a simple spontaneous eruption of contempt mingled with rage. Some have muttered that I went to his page to harass him; that\\'s not the case. I went to continue a discussion that had been interrupted by earlier admin action. Some are muttering that I went there to \"\"bait\"\" or \"\"poke\"\" him into a block. I appreciate the complement but my Machiavellian intelligence is non-existant. Obviously. \\n\\nI lost respect for Malleus when he said, \"\"You already succeeded in getting me blocked, so I can only presume that you\\'re trying to repeat the trick.\"\" I had made it clear that I had no intention of getting him blocked, he knew it, and yet regurgitated this populist slur. That\\'s where he opened the door for my unmitigated opinion.\\n\\nBut my rant wasn\\'t aimed at the dishonesty I perceived in that comment, that simply gave me permission to express a much deeper revulsion that\\'s been building in me over the last few months with respect to this project. \\n\\nIt\\'s a feeling, so I\\'m not sure I can make it clear. A kind of nauseous disgust. It\\'s to do with how we deal with the hurt we may cause others, other editors, our subjects and our readers. I\\'m pleased to see the faltering steps being taken toward a more civil ethos here. Those who actually know me know that means a great deal to me. There is a long way to go. Pesky pointed out that finding the right form of words for what\\'s required is difficult. I agree. That\\'s the challenge. The right form of words will emerge if we discuss these questions enough.\\n\\nWith regard to respectful discourse between editors, Malleus has been addressing the real root of the civility problem here for years. Telling someone to fuck off, or calling them a cunt is obviously uncivil and an easy call for an admin. But the real evil here is not Malleus and me calling each other names, it\\'s the sleazy aside from one editor to another, undermining the reputation of a third. One editor can bully or badger another for days or weeks without ever calling them a name, and it\\'s their victim that cops a block when they respond accordingly. So I\\'m glad to see more admins taking civility seriously, but you\\'re going to have to work on the sophistication of your approach.\\n\\nI\\'m disgusted by the way this project treats its readers with regard to controversial images. The bit that disgusts me is the mantra that \"\"we don\\'t care if we offend our readers.\"\" Seriously. That has been repeated ad nauseam during the Muhammad images debates and others. I can see no excuse for that attitude, and don\\'t want to participate in an enterprise that has that attitude towards its readership.\\n\\nAnd finally, contempt for our subjects. I first noticed this on a BLP. A teenage girl and her boyfriend made a sex tape. Later, when she was a minor local celebrity, the tape was posted on the net, without her permission. It\\'s there now; Google her name and \"\"sex tape\"\" and you got it. She\\'s now won a TV competition, so is becoming better known.\\n\\nThe tape\\'s existence has been mentioned a few times in the press, but not much, and usually the \"\"nudge, nudge, lucky bastard\"\" type of comment, but it doesn\\'t seem to have affected her career or even her private life. An RfC asked \"\"Should we mention the tape?\"\" Policy-wise you can make a case for its inclusion, but it\\'s borderline. What really disgusted me was the utter unconcern of many editors for the effect our inclusion of the factoid would have on the visibility of the tape, and the consequent effect this would have on the woman. I won\\'t elaborate further; you either get it or you don\\'t.\\n\\nAnd it was concern for the subject of a BLP that brought Malleus and me together. He was arguing for the preservation of a borderline notable BLP that the subject said was distressing him. I argued that it should go, simply because it\\'s borderline notable and the subject doesn\\'t want it. \\n\\nAlthough Malleus asserted the wishes of the subject are irrelevant, an assertion he is incapable of justifying, and a position I find morally repugnant, he deemed it appropriate to also declare the subject\\'s claim of distress is implausible. Unfortunately, Jimbo had already primed me with a similar judgment. Jimbo had ignored my response, so I thought I\\'d add a little emphasis when I explained my view to Malleus.\\n\\nI\\'ve suffered chronic pain and fatigue since I had an unnecessary medical intervention at the a',\n",

After editing the page on Irreducible complexity to make it more neutral, my changes were reverted, and I received the following message from the aforementioned user:\\n\\nWelcome to Wikipedia, and thank you for your contributions. One of the core policies of Wikipedia is that articles should always be written from a neutral point of view. A contribution you made to Irreducible complexity appears to carry a non-neutral point of view, and your edit may have been changed or reverted to correct the problem. Please remember to observe this. Thank you. ID and the like is virtually universally disregarded and is not taken seriously by the scientific community. To say that only \"\"some\"\" of the scientific community is giving WP:UNDUE weight to a minority position, a position based on theology, not science SÆdon \\n\\nI\\'m fairly new here to Wikipedia, but I understand the basic rules regarding article editing, particularly involving mandatory neutrality. I\\'m confident that none of my additions were non-neutral in any way which biased the article. They were criticisms of criticisms of irreducible complexity  precisely the sort of thing expected for a neutral, fair-and-balanced article on irreducible complexity. Surely neutrality requires that both arguments for and against controversial ideas be presented, no? What the actions of SÆdon and the other watchdogs of any article involving the Darwinian evolution vs. intelligent design controversy say is that only one side of the issue, theirs, deserves to be presented. This is textbook neutrality  exactly what Wikipedia strives to avoid.\\n\\nNotice the non-neutrality in Saedon\\'s message:\\n\\nID and the like is virtually universally disregarded and is not taken seriously by the scientific community.\\n\\nThis is an example of either dishonesty of ignorance on Saedon\\'s part. Intelligent design is one of the hottest topics in science today precisely because it is taken seriously by the so-called \"\"scientific community.\"\" They take it seriously because it\\'s a very powerful, evidence-based argument that poses a great threat to the current orthodoxy, Darwinian evolution. This is why Saedon and the like watch over any and all articles regarding this debate, making sure they remain heavily biased towards Darwinian evolution, while reverting both arguments for I.D. and criticisms of criticisms against I.D., as happened in my case.\\n\\n\\nTo say that only \"\"some\"\" of the scientific community is giving WP:UNDUE weight to a minority position, a position based on theology, not science\\n\\nTo say that only \"\"some\"\" of the scientific community views I.D. as pseudoscience is a factual statement. While they may be in the minority, there are many members of the scientific community who agree wholeheartedly that I.D. is science. To close your eyes, shove your fingers in your ears, and pretend that these scientists do not exist  as Saedon has done  is intellectual dishonesty. To then permeate Wikipedia with that intellectual dishonesty is unacceptable. Notice, too, Saedon\\'s non-neutral opinion that intelligent design is theology, rather than science.\\n\\nI refute that claim.\\n\\nI\\'m atheist regarding the Gods of any organized religion, and yet I fully accept the scientific-basis of intelligent design. It\\'s no more theological than is big bang cosmology, or even its counterpart, Darwinian evolution. While all three views may have (a)theistic implications, the argumentation and observation behind all three are strictly secular and scientific. For Saedon to baldly assert that intelligent design is theology, and use this bald assertion to further justify his non-neutrality, watchdog-like behavior is unacceptable.\\n\\nI expect this situation to be dealt with accordingly; fairly, without bias, and absent bald assertions and loaded claims that encourage, if not outright justify, that bias.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n  \"',\n",
       "       '=Invitation to workshops on Wikipedia editing==\\nDear Ploversegg,\\n\\nWe are a team of researchers at the University of Oxford and AU Sharjah, researching the experiences of editors of content about the Arab world on Wikipedia. We are interested in your experiences of editing Wikipedia and are organising two events that we think you would be an excellent contributor to.\\n\\nFirst, starting next week on Monday 27th August, we are hosting an online discussion about what it is like to contribute to Wikipedia in Arabic and to articles about the Middle East and North Africa. We are interested in what barriers you perceive to exist in Wikipedia, how articles can be made better and generally what can be done to expand and improve Arabic Wikipedia. This discussion will take place on a MediaWiki hosted at our institution and be available in English and Arabic. We will allow users to create their own discussion pages in addition to our discussions.\\n\\nSecond, we are hosting face-to-face workshops in Cairo from 21st-22nd October 2012. If you are interested in this we may be able to pay your travel and accommodation costs depending on where you live. This workshop will cover similar themes to the online discussion but will allow participants to meet one another and benefit from being together.  \\n\\nWe will take care of the organization and planning and all you have to do is show up and be ready to discuss. But if you would like to help shape some of the discussion themes in advance, please let us know. We have booked time in the workshops for Wikipedian-led discussions.  \\n\\nMore details can be found in our “Frequently Asked Questions” section below. \\n\\nWe would be delighted to welcome you to either (or both) event. Please let me know (wikiproject@oii.ox.ac.uk) if you would like to participate and we can send you more details.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nMark, Bernie, Ilhem, Ali, Ahmed and Heather\\n\\nDr. Mark Graham, Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford\\nDr. Bernie Hogan, Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford\\nDr. Ilhem Allagui, Department of Mass Communication, American University of Sharjah\\nDr. Ali Frihida, National Engineering School of Tunis \\nHeather Ford, Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford\\nAhmed Medhat, Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions:\\n \\nWhat is the purpose of this project?\\n\\nThis project is about who represents the Arab World on Wikipedia, and how the Middle East and the Arab world is represented on Wikipedia. We are studying Wikipedia through statistics, edit  history data and personal experiences. Our ultimate goal is to help Wikipedia grow in size and fairness and do academic research on this topic. You can read more about the project here: http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/?id70 From this page, you can also find a biography of the researchers. You may also want to see our interactive visualizations about Wikipedia here: http://wikiproject.oii.ox.ac.uk/ \\n\\n\\nWho is funding this project?\\n\\nThis project is funded by the International Development Research Centre (http://www.idrc.ca). This organization is funded by the Canadian government to improve infrastructure across the world, including online content. We have been working with the IDRC since June 2010. \\n\\nWhy did you contact me?\\n\\nBecause you’re awesome. In all seriousness, we have been looking through Wikipedia for active editors based on user activity in either Arabic Wikipedia or articles about the Arab world. We have not contacted everyone we could, but we contact people that we think will help to balance the discussion and help us (and each other) learn more about the state of Wikipedia.  \\n\\nDo I need to participate in both events?\\n\\nNot at all. You are welcome to participate in both or just one. We recognise that it will be more convenient for some people to have online conversations and for others to speak in person. For some people it will not be practical to fly to the Middle East, but we still consider their contributions important and want to give them a voice in this work.\\n\\nCan I use my Wikipedia handle in the online discussion?\\n\\nYou do not need to use any particular name on the online forum. All we need is a valid email address so you can register. You can post using your real name, your Wikipedia name or a completely different nickname, whatever allows you to speak your mind most effectively. \\n\\nWhat sort of travel funding will you supply for the face-to-face workshop?\\n\\nWe have funding for travel and accommodation costs for approximately twenty participants depending on where they are coming from.

       "       '\"\\n\\n==WhoMe\\'s new introduction==\\n\\nAfter the last few days many of us from both sides of the fence had worked out an informative introduction that was both clear and covered the main points. Most importantly it described the view of the official body for naming astronomical nomenclature and combined both their working definition for extrasolar planets and their more recent definition for out own solar system in a clear fashion to inform people in the opening paragraph. The new intro is junk. Please can we amend this without having an edit war.  \\n\\n:Having looked at the lastest changes/reverts/whatever made by yourself, I find the recent changes to be much clearer than when I originally started discussing this controversy.  Despite many objections on both sides, the article is much clearer.  I\\'m assuming here that what is currently is what you want the article to look like.  I certainly won\\'t start an edit war over it! I\\'ve never participated in an edit war and I don\\'t intend to start now. —  (comment)  \\n\\n::Actually, I would have preferred just listing \"\"A planet is officially defined as...\"\" but now it has been amended so:\\n:::a) there are links a the naming dispute both in the first sentence as well as the sandbox\\n:::b) it is not listed as the official definition, just as a definition by the IAU\\n:::c) it is noted that this is recent and also that there were alternate lists before this\\n:::d) there is link to the astrology article that defines planet differently\\n:::e) there is a quantifier to say it may not be universally accepted.\\n::I think not to address the IAU definition in the introduction is more POV than including it, giving its significance. We have already given it far less credit than all reports in the mainstream and scientific media.  \\n\\n:::Well at least one entry (d) does not need to be there.  I added it to the disambiguation page, so that should be sufficient.  There is no need to list it on this page explicitly. —  (comment)  \\n\\n::::I felt that seeing that the astrology term described many of the same objects as the astronomy term there should be a direct link, especially given the dispute over Pluto, which, as you rightly pointed out, will still be counted by many astronomers. However, if you still feel it should be taken out I won\\'t object. And for the record, despite the initial clash of heads I\\'ve enjoyed working with you on this and you have persuaded me to be a lot closer to your view. Thanks.  \\n\\n:::::I\\'m not terribly concerned about the astrology link, one way or another.  It isn\\'t intrusive.  As for this discussion, I really havn\\'t even been editing the article or really following the changes as closely as others have been.  This discussion is so time consuming!  When I first ran accross the article I was deeply concerned with the slant, but there has been a lot of work.  I still have issues with using the word \"\"official\"\", since only 424 persons out of 2,411 (approximately 18%) who attended the IAU assembly even voted on the issue and there are enough published articles showing the controversy that the vote has caused.  With that said, the introductory paragraph does a good job at mentioning the lack of a historical scientific agreement for the definition of planet.  This balance may be sufficient to show all sides on this debate.  I might like it if it was the \"\"official scientific body\"\", because surely there are no other organizations that can make that claim and it still leaves room for \"\"unofficial cultural definitions\"\", such as those widely used by the general public. Ironically, I think the article may now focus a little too much attention on the naming controversy.  I would put \"\"Definition\"\" and \"\"Disagreement\"\" under the main heading of \"\"Etymology\"\".  I think it would flow better and put less emphasis on the controversy.  Afterall, the definition of the word is what Etymology is all about, and the controversy occurred chronologically after the information currently under the heading of Etymology. —  (comment)  \\n\\n::::::I deliberately changed the se',\n",
       "       '\":::::::Well, you have long given me a headache, and it doesn\\'t seem that you are ever going to fully understand why you\\'ve been wrong to remove this information. So I should stop replying to you and let you get the last word here on your talk page. However, you did state \"\"For some of the claims, there are evidence, but others, there are not.\"\" So that\\'s a start to  you seemingly acknowledging your belief that there is some valid evidence for the material you dispute.  \\n\\n:::::::The text doesn\\'t state that \"\"men [don\\'t know] how to.\"\" It states something that Kinsey concluded, and it is clearly attributed to Kinsey  \"\"Kinsey attributed this difference to female partners knowing more about women\\'s sexuality and how to optimize women\\'s sexual satisfaction than male partners do.\"\" We are allowed to mention researchers\\' conclusions, and this conclusion by Kinsey is especially relevant to the text. It\\'s also what I just stated above: \"\"Obviously, women generally know what makes other women feel good sexually, which is what the researchers are saying.\"\" It is your opinion and a case-by-case basis that \"\"having orgasms most of the time during sex does not equal sexual satisfaction in a relationship.\"\" I state that because it\\'s not the same case for everyone. It is also your opinion that lesbians experience less sexual satisfaction in a relationship. The sources you kept removing state the very opposite of what you assert about sexual satisfication in lesbian relationships. And because they do, you\\'ve asserted that they are biased and/or unreliable. They are not. Those sources are what most of the research states about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Most of the sources do not state what Schwartz stated about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. Not even half of reliable sources state that. Her view is a minority view, and it\\'s also an outdated view because of what I\\'ve noted already. It hasn\\'t been replicated. New research on lesbian sexuality consistently reports the opposite of Schwartz\\'s assertion about sexual satisfaction in lesbian relationships. And I reiterate that Schwartz was focusing on long-term lesbian relationships, not just on lesbian relationships in general.   \\n\\n::::::::The article is not a comparison article. It mentions a few comparisons to heterosexual sex in the Research section because these comparisons are notable and especially relevant to the topic. This is because researchers have often studied that aspect of lesbian sexuality, to help them better understand it as compared to heterosexual sexual activity. They obviously didn\\'t see that it was needed or especially relevant to compare lesbian sexual satisfaction to gay male sexual satisfaction. And since gay male couples don\\'t include women, I can see why they felt that way. They were comparing how women are sexually satisfied by a different sex/gender. They brought heterosexual couples into it. It wasn\\'t Wikipedia that did that. And we should report on it because they did and made it a big part of studies on lesbian sexuality. Simply listing stats doesn\\'t sufficiently inform readers of this information, unless those stats are as detailed as the text. And you really need to stop citing that discredited Schwartz study as though it is a majority or widely held view among researchers. It isn\\'t. But I agree that it should be included in the article. \\n\\n::::::::We don\\'t have to list stats for the lines you quoted above. What we have to do is follow the sources. If the sources had stats, then maybe we would include those. But including them also doesn\\'t mean that they would be traded out for the text material. The \"\"Other elements of lesbian sexual encounters include more full-body sexual contact\"\" line is about lesbians only, and it\\'s supported by two reliable sources. I understand that you take objection with that paragraph because it\\'s stating that women in same-sex sexual relationships are more satisfied, sexually and in life in general, but it\\'s what the sources say. Still, it would probably be better to attribute that to the author(s) reporting it. We don\\'t have to present a survey that asked heterosexual women and lesbian women their sexual satisfaction levels. That is covered by the sources, and only material especially relevant to the topic of lesbian sexual practices should be included. And, yeah, you have made claims. And, no, you don\\'t present sources. Not generally. For sources, all you\\'ve done is repeatedly note the Schwartz study, no matter how many times I point out to you that it is discredited, and you state that \"\"many other sources\"\" show the opposite of the material you kept removing. If there were many other sources of such nature, you\\'d be able to present one other than the Schwartz study, which is not an opposing study (as in a study directly going against what the studies in the article have found). As for adding claims to the article, you changed wordin',\n",

The laboratory scale apparatus for the production of specific isotopes, radioactive materials (radioisotopes) Prtvdarvha as well as for medical and laboratory and industrial scale for the production of electricity are made \\nHistory \\n\\nThe first controlled nuclear fission energy was achieved in December 1942. Construction and operation of a cell led by a form of graphite bricks and uranium and uranium oxide fuel successfully concluded. The cell nuclear football at the University of Chicago was the first nuclear reactor was operating. \\n\\n\\n\\n Reactor Building \\n\\nDespite the diversity of the reactors, almost all of them are composed of the same components. These components include the fuel cover fuel to slow neutrons from fission, cool stacks for transporting thermal energy from the fission process is controlled to control the fission rate. \\n\\nFuel for nuclear reactors should be such that undergo fission neutrons can be obtained. Five Fissile Nuclides that are currently used in reactors. 232Th, 233U, 235U, 238U, 239Pu. Some Nuclides from the thermal neutrons for fission and some fast neutrons are also produced by fission. Reactor fuel is a difference between property in Uncategorized. The ability of fission fuel used in nuclear reactors must be able to meet other needs. Fuel must be mechanically strong, chemically stable against the radiation damage resistance, so the reactor does not undergo physical and chemical changes. The thermal conductivity of the material must be high enough so that the heat can move easily. It is also possible to obtain, making a comfortable, relatively low cost and non-hazardous chemicals and other benefits in terms of fuel. \\n\\nPod reactor \\n\\nNuclear fuels are put directly into the reactor, but has always been used as a cover. Covered or sheathed fuel, moderator and coolant it apart. This corrosion protection and fuel the spread of fission products from irradiated fuel to the environment is prevented. The pods could also fuel support structure and heat transfer to help. Materials such as fuel pods have good thermal and mechanical properties and the chemical interaction with the fuel material is stable environment. It is sheathed with a low cross towards nuclear interactions of neutrons and is resistant against radiation. \\n\\n Neutron moderator materials \\n\\nA substance that can slow or rapid thermal neutrons are used up. The kernel has a mass close to the mass of the neutron is slow is best. The reactor will be used for the lower neutron absorption cross-section should be. Due to the properties of slow, there are some substances that can be used. Hydrogen, deuterium, beryllium and carbon are some examples moderator. Because beryllium is toxic, it is too low to be used in reactors. The isotopes of hydrogen, heavy water, and the water and carbon, in the form of graphite as a material to be used. \\n\\nHeavy water in some types of nuclear reactors as a neutron moderator is used. They can react with uranium to neutrons. Than conventional light water or water can also be used as a moderator, but because light water absorbs the thermal neutrons are light water reactors need enriched uranium to use high purity, But heavy water reactors can not enrich uranium or conventional uses heavy water so the discussion is to prevent the development of nuclear weapons. Heavy water reactors can be built in a way that requires no equipment enriched uranium to make plutonium for use in nuclear weapons. However, conventional uranium for use in nuclear weapons could be used in other ways, too.This material controls. But in non-industrialized countries like America and Canada, it means much gram and kilogram quantities without any specific authorization of the manufacturers or supplier chemicals supplied. The price per kilogram of heavy water with a purity of 9899% in about 600 to 700 dollars. It also can not use enriched uranium and heavy water plutonium production reactor construction. Just as pure carbon, super slow since the Nazis use of impure carbon use, they did not notice the truth of America's first experimental nuclear reactor in 1942 and the Manhattan Project and the Trinity test of the plutonium bomb, known as «FAT MAN »the manufacture of enriched uranium or heavy water is not used. \\n\\nCooler \\n\\n\\n\\nHeat from fission in the reactor or fuel must be removed from the heat too high or the fuel rods melt. Heat is the fuel in the reactor power may be used to generate electricity. Characteristics of the coolant should be directed to heat the heat transfer can be effective. Also, chemical stability and lower neutron absorption cross section of two major properties Knndhast cool. Another point that must be noted\",\n",

Oh well.\\n\\nBiography and creativity\\n \\n[edit] Early years\\n \\nViktoria Daynekos born on 12 May 1987 in village in the Kirov Taldy-Kurgan area. Her childhood was spent in the Yakut city Mirny (Yakutia). Since her childhood, she dreamed of becoming a variety singer, but her parents did not take her desire seriously. In school, Victoria (Vika) started to sing various Mirny (Yakutia) musical genres, mainly covering the hits of others. As she was in a small town, without any special educational institutions, Vika educated herself.  Vika seriously engaged the English language.\\n \\n[edit] Star Factory\\n \\nAlla Pugacheva is DOUBTLESS a link here... should be looked up and added\\n\\nIn 2004 Victoria was the participant of the Channel One’s teleproject Star Factory Series 5 under the direction of Alla Pugacheva, which she won. Within the limits of the teleproject, Victoria sang two solo songs — «I will be better» and \"\"Leila\"\".  Vika also sang a duet with Alexander Marshal «Dreamed me». ((I Dreamed?!  Dreamed of me,?!)) The duet was so pleasant to the public, that it has been decided to make a joint clip — Victoria\\'s first video.\\n \\n[edit] \"\"Post-factory\"\" life\\n \\n[edit] 2005—2006\\n \\nAfter the termination of the teleproject, Victoria began serious work Igor Matvienko. The debut clip of singer for the song \"\"Leila\"\" was shot in 2005 in Thailand. New songs with which, Vika acted on the various platforms, new further clips have followed. In parallel with this development, Victoria\\'s life was often discussed in press—in 2006, the singer dated the member of the group «Korni» Pavel Artemyev. Although the affair did not last long, it has left a trace — a clip plot on a song of Dayneko «I will simply leave from you at once» (\"\"Я просто сразу от тебя уйду\"\") based on the idea of director Victor Priduvalov and a hit has been closely connected with the Korni’s clip «You want I will sing to you» (\"\"Хочешь, я тебе спою\"\")\\n \\n[edit] 2007\\n \\nIn the beginning of 2007, Victoria wrote a soundtrack to the film «In expectation of a miracle» — «Film not about love».  A videoclip on this song was made in parallel with filming.\\n \\nShe was nominated in the autumn of 2007 as «Best performer» in the MTV Russia Music Awards. ((Fragment, as a result of having conceded to the singer MakSim.)) Also she was the winner channel Fashion TV award «fashion-singer of 2007».\\n \\nIn the beginning of the same year, Victoria took part in photos for April issue of magazine Playboy, which she has regretted.\\n \\nIn 2007 she also participated in the project Glacial Age. In this project she was \"\"star\"\", being trained and supported by Alexei Yagudin — the first class figure skater. Victoria and Alexei reached the project ending, but did not reach prize-winning places.\\n \\nWith Alexei, Vika wrote a song \"\"Needle\"\", of which there has been made a videoclip. There are rumours about a novel.  To date, theya re only rumours.\\n \\nAlso in 2007 Victoria tried out in film. She appeared in a a small, bit part, in a teleserial «Happy Together», where Vika has played herself; She has also has voiced the main heroine Panti in an animation «Noev an ark» with the Russian version of a Gloria Gaynor’s song «I Will Survive».\\n \\n[edit] 2008— present\\n \\nOn 6 March 2008 She released a debut album \"\"Needle\"\".

       "       '\"\\n\\n== Wikipedia Ambassador update! ==\\n\\n\\nHi! You\\'re getting this message because you are or have been a Wikipedia Ambassador. A new term is beginning for the United States and Canada Education Programs, and I wanted to give you an update on some important new information if you\\'re interested in continuing your work this term as a Wikipedia Ambassador. \\n\\nYou may have heard a reference to a transition the education program is going through. This is the last term that the Wikimedia Foundation will directly run the U.S. and Canada programs; beginning in June, a proposed thematic organization is likely to take over organizing the program. You can read more about the proposal here.\\n\\nAnother major change in the program will take effect immediately. Beginning this term, a new MediaWiki education extension will replace all course pages and Ambassador lists. (See Wikipedia:Course pages and Help:Education Program extension for more details.) Included in the extension are online volunteer and campus volunteer user rights, which let you create and edit course pages and sign up as an ambassador for a particular course.\\n\\nIf you would like to continue serving as a Wikipedia Ambassador — even if you do not support a class this term — you must create an ambassador profile. If you\\'re no longer interested in being a Wikipedia Ambassador, you don\\'t need to do anything.\\n\\n;Please do these steps as soon as possible\\nFirst, you need the relevant user rights for Online and/or Campus Ambassadors. (If you are an admin, you can grant the rights yourself, for you as well as other ambassadors.) Just post your rights request here, and we\\'ll get you set up as quickly as possible.\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve got the ambassador rights, please set up at a Campus and/or Online Ambassador profile. You can do so at:\\n*Special:CampusAmbassadorProfile\\n*Special:OnlineAmbassadorProfile\\n\\nGoing forward, the lists of Ambassadors at Special:CampusAmbassadors and Special:OnlineAmbassadors will be the official roster of who is an active Ambassador. If you would like to be an Ambassador but not ready to serve this term, you can un-check the option in your profile to publicly list it (which will remove your profile from the list).\\n\\nAfter that, you can sign on to support courses. The list of courses will be at Special:Courses. (By default, this lists \"\"Current\"\" courses, but you can change the Status filter to \"\"Planned\"\" to see courses for this term that haven\\'t reached their listed start date yet.)\\n\\nAs this is the first term we have used the extension, we know there will be some bugs, and we know the feature set is not as rich as it could be. (A big wave of improvements is already in the pipeline. And if you know MediaWiki and could help with code review, we\\'d love to have your help!) Please reach out to  with any complaints, bug reports, and feature suggestions. The basic features of the extension are documented at Wikipedia:Course pages, and you can see a tutorial for setting up and using them here.\\n\\n;Communication and keeping up to date\\nIn the past, the Education Program has had a pretty fragmented set of communication channels. We\\'re trying to fix that. These are the recommended places to discuss and stay up-to-date on the education program:\\n# The education noticeboard has become the main on-wiki location for discussion of the Education Program. You can post there about broad education program issues as well as issues with individual courses.\\n# The Ambassadors Announce email list is a very low-traffic announcements list of important information all Ambassadors need to be aware of. We encourage all Ambassadors (and other interested Wikipedians) to subscribe to the list; follow the instructions on the link to add your email address.\\n# If you use IRC regularly, or need to try to reach someone immediately, the  IRC channel is the place to find me and fellow Ambassadors.\\n\\n;Ambassador training and resources\\nWe now have an online training for Ambassadors, which is intended to be both an orientation about the Wikipedia Ambassador role for newcomers and the manual for how to do the role. (There are parallel trainings for students and for educators as well.)\\n\\nPlease go through the training if you feel like you need a refresher on how a typical class is supposed to go and where t',\n",

Here, and here. But having failed at deletion twice, for two years now, Novaseminary has also failed at WP:LETITGO. He persistently challenges the BLP\\'s notability and threatens to start a 3rd deletion attempt. He also regularly violates WP:DE. He edit wars and disruptively edits almost on a daily basis, pushes POV, attacks other articles because they are mentioned in the BLP, creates suspect disambig stubs, insists on irrelevant or dated edits, violates OR, uses citation tags to edit war, like here, here, here and here, removes sourced quotes and attacks and fights to include and spreads unflattering and irrelevant material about the BLP\\'s subject over several editor\\'s objections.\\n \\nBut Novaseminary is also knowledgeable of WP rules. So knowledgeable that he uses WP to argue & defend his indefensible actions, even as he ignores all the WP rules & policies that his tendentious editing violates. He cites the rules that give him cover, and just ignores those that expose his tactics as disruptive. Recommend an immediate topic ban. Not just for the Douglas Tait (stuntman) BLP, but for all the articles sourced in the BLP. Otherwise he will just retaliate by continuing to disrupt them. 2602:304:5EA1:52A9:A449:F5CE:8339:FCA2 (talk) \\n This looks like a content dispute. Have you taken this to WP:DRN as a first port of call? Ritchie333 (talk) (cont) \\nUnfortunately, it\\'s more than a content issue. It\\'s a persistent, long-term pattern of disruptive behavior.

I\\'m going to give Novaseminary time to respond, but I strongly lean towards a topic ban for both users. – Steel \\n You know what? I\\'ll accept that. If Novaseminary is topic banned, I\\'ll voluntarily self-ban. My only request is that the last edit before the ban is monitored/reviewed by uninvolved 3rd party/parties to insure no Novaseminary POV.

The IP seems to care more about how this person is presented favorably than about the nietrality of WP, but it tough to know what else if anything this IP has edited.

Almost everything i\\'ve done i\\'ve discussed at talk. I have only even edited this over the last few weeks because an IP came along and removed well sourced text without discussion until posted at a NB. Novaseminary (talk) \\nI would also point out, I only nominated this article for deletion once, with no consensus. I actually came across it at the first successful AfD nom made, not by me, but another editor. The IP seems to think I have had it out for this person, but I have been only one of several editors to do things the IP apparently disapproves of, but that I think comply with policy.

Novaseminary (talk) \\nOur IP user has agreed to a self-ban from this article providing you do the same.

       "       '\"I had nearly moved on when I felt completely compelled to comment on this statement \"\"probably better than most clan websites, which tend to be based on long outdated stuff from the 19th century. Then I do not see a problem in using it until a better source can be found. Especially to make amends to the masses of unsourced information that is found on so many of the individual clan articles\"\". I can only interpet this as something is probably better because it is newer?? This makes no sense to me. History is what it is, it should not change for the sake of change. If it was accurate over 600 years ago, it is just as accurate today. Again, if something is true and accurate hundreds or even thousands of years ago, it is not and should not be subject to change because someone decides to re-write it for either personal gain or an agenda. That is exactly what has happened with the origins for many Highland Clans. For any that might be interested, William Skene\\'s and John Murray\\'s collaboration of The Highlanders of Scotland: Their Origin, History and Antiquities is a wonderful and refreshing read. This is more than likely the truest accounting for several of the Highland Clans. It asserts that many of the origin claims put forth in more recent times are attempts to gain a foothold on the Chieftainship, by usurping the rightful lines. You\\'ll find that cadet septs used this technique to basically try to re-write history for their own selfish gain. You\\'d have to read the book to see how this played out but as I said before, nearly ALL of the Highland Clans being \"\"bastardized\"\" as Norman/Anglo-Horman/Flemish, etc. are really Dalriadan and Pictish mixes. Examples would be Campbell, Cameron, Grant, Davidson, Wallace, etc. I of course have distant YDNA connections to ALL of these surnames, but I know no one wants to hear about that as any sort of evidence. I\\'ll admit not one of these surnames or clans has a pure lineage, but they all have a lineage going back to the Picts and Gaels. I am of that lineage, which is quite rare and continues to be established. The masses are not of that lineage, they are a mix if R1A1, other R1B haplotypes, the I haplotypes, etc. I will be the first to admit there may be hundreds of families, not even related through a shared male ancestor, sharing a surname or Clan. My concern is with the origins only, and the original Chiefly lines. And please don\\'t tell me how we are a mix of so much dna, I am only referring to YDNA, the male lines. I am not talking about MTDNA nor Autosomal. What I don\\'t understand is why when there is so much sourced information out there, some editors choose only to use factually inaccurate \"\"sourced\"\" information. There is substantial \"\"factually accurate\"\" sourced information out there however it is not my intent, to correct these erroneous articles or to present an \"\"opposing view\"\". There is no opposing view, there is either the truth, or their are lies. Either the Celtic version is correct, or the Comyn version is correct, or neither is correct. There can\\'t factually be multiple versions of an origin, it is what it is and there is only one true origin. This is not a contest to see who can provide more recent sources. I would hope wikipedia would want the truth out there, and not contests of who can out edit who, which is what wikipedia appears to be. There, my case is presented to the message and not a specific messenger. Clan Davidson is Celtic, it descended from Celts and it has no connection to the Comyn family. It did not descend from a Comyn male. They came from a very ancient Gaelic ancestor, an ancestor shared by several Highland Clans, before surnames even were in use. One other greatly incorrect update to this site was the battle alleged between the Davidson\\'s and the MacPherson\\'s....this never happened. The battle was between the Clans fighting for the Chief of the Clan Chattan, the battle was fought between the Mackintoshs and the MacPhersons.The MacPhersons were the true chiefly line, but were \"\"out-documented\"\" by the usurping Mackintosh. This is pretty much exactly what is happening here, on this very page. I hope someone else has more time and energy to properly update this page with the correct information and let\\'s bury the lies and factually inaccurate information comprising most of this article. It was originally much more factually accurate, but over the course of time has been corrupted with sourced information that is not also factually accurate.\\n\\n\"',\n",

Beginning with this, I have explained more successfully some import theory questions in the area of the present physics, cosmology and philosophy ect. At same time a few of new reasons have been raised But this is only rough idea of physical philosophy. many key details need to be answered by the improving science in the future.\\nKey words: repulsion particle, the velocity of light, red shift, cosmos background.\\n  \\n\\u3000\\u3000\\u3000While the researched object of physics are increasingly getting its limit observed through the instrument, the function in the research of academic ideas are more important. In this article, only assumes the existence of a new particle, so it seems possible for many difficulty of physics and cosmology to be resulted. Maybe the key to unlock the door of advancing access of physics lies not in the building of physics, but in the palace of philosophy.\\n\\nOne、Grounds of advancing the existence of  “repulsion particle” \\n\\nPhilosophic puzzles: gravity and repulsion, this is a pair of antiquated contradiction, theory of physics is a philosophic  lame. Angels said that the true theory  of matter should give the equal status to gravity and repulsion, the theory of matter only based on gravity is wrong, insufficiency and unilateral. Newton needed to find the first driving force for his physics, or else the world can’t act .\\nThere is contradiction between Newton’s law of universal gravitation and Einstein’s mass-velocity expression. In the law universal gravitation, the magnitude of gravitation is direct proportional to mass of the matter, the bigger the mass is, the stronger the gravity is; while in the mass-velocity expression, with the speed of the matter increasing, the mass will add. If the “mass” of the two law is the same, then the speed of matter will increase, and the gravity will be stronger, the matter will be drawn too tighten to move by the gravity. But in fact, it’s just opposition, the shotted cannonball is incline to break loose the gravitation, provided that the speed is high enough, it is able to fly off the orbit of the earth, even the solar system. This shows that the mass of adding with the speed increasing is different with that works on the gravitation, because it manifest obviously a kind of repulsion confronting the gravitation.  So that, the two characteristics (speed increases, gravitation reduces; speed reduces, gravitation increases.) out while the state of moving matter changes .it is right to reflect the invert process between gravity and repulsion inside the moving matter , and indicate the existence of difference idiocratic mass.\\nNewton believed: falling of an apple is because of the function of gravitation, then, we can question in the opposition, how can the apple get to the top of the tree? If we block out all of the complicated growing process of all tree with black-box theory, and only consider the beginning and the ending state, then, in the opinion of physics, there must be a kind of universal repulsion fighting back the gravitation working on the apple and pushing it to the high place. Therefor, the universal repulsion should exist everywhere, as well as the universal gravitation.\\nWhat is the essence of “force”? This question has been disputing for hundreds of years, and it’s still not clear today. Newton said that it is the measurement of the acceleration of moving matter. But this only describes the force, not explains the essential mechanism. So, in Newton mechanics, the mass of  the moving matter is unchangeable. Einstein brought out the character that the mass of matter is changed with the speed. He thought the activity of matter is result from getting energy, while energy can agglomerate matter, and this character of this matter is the same as the original matter, so can be added, resulting that the mass of matter may trend to infinite with the speed increasing. If we can import a kind of repulsion to explain it, and give the energy a carrier of practicality, then, the relation of movement and the “force” will be more clear.\\nThe radiant energy is always multiple of some elementary unit, what on earth is the physical meaning of Plank quantum constants? If it can be seen as a material particle, and indicate the existence of repulsion particle? Ray radiation has the two character of wave and particle itself. As to E=h*v, Plank regarded the radiant energy as constant h multiply frequency v from the site of wave theory; if, from the point of particle theory,  we can regard it as the h combination of v quantu',\n",

       "       '\\n\\nDear few wiki editors who claim now to own wiki\\nWhen these things become personal they can become petty. I don’t believe you have the competence to authorize a lifetime ban on another wiki editor ie another human being. Wiki doesn’t work that way. Neither do computers. You might approve of the techniques of third world dictatorships. But you’ll find it hard to enforce that kind of censorship on any part of the internet that isn’t entirely your own. Unless one of you is the wiki founder in which case you changed your tune mate not giving you any more donations.\\nI was informed of the recent spate of death threats against Sharmila via a Mumbai Activist who received a message from a Manipuri who didn’t want to be named. I asked for 24 hours grace from wiki on exceptional grounds because the threats were made only because the Authorities believe they can control media coverage of what they do. What the Nazis told the Jews they murdered in the death camps was that no one would ever know what would happen to them, that when they were all dead they would turn the camps into gardens. Even the memory of their existence would be expunged. Yes in that I am comparing you to a bunch of Nazis. I don’t know how the story broke only that wiki had nothing to do with it.\\n On 7th November at her fortnightly judicial remand hearing a reporter for a national Indian Television News Channel managed an 11 minute interview with Sharmila. You may be aware even if a reporter has a documented story they require multiple confirmations, sort of like wiki but these people have a broad and deep background knowledge of the culture politics history and current events around the topic. Wiki editors blindly follow protocols and then mix that with prejudice and uninformed reasoning often removing important disclosures because they lack any qualifications or experience to judge what matters. \\nThe page on Irom Sharmila has shrunk over the past two years because of the moronic conduct of a few over aggressive editors with too much time who race about different articles expunging data based on idiosyncratic nonsense. Content makes no difference to them whether they are editing articles on UFO sightings, the history of double entry bookkeeping or Irom Sharmila. \\nSome examples are one editor decided loads of people are nominated for the long list of the Nobel Prize so he removed her nomination based on his opinion that long list nominations are not noteworthy. Hundreds of people are nominated every year for the long list. But there are now 7 billion people on this planet and I don’t believe any wiki editor has ever received a nomination or personally knows anyone who has. The short list is not published so wiki editors could argue it’s pure speculation. However informed opinion is published yearly by several respected organizations I believe one is called the Olaf trust (google is very helpful try it). For at least two consecutive years they have posited Sharmila as a possible on the short list which is always a single figure guess. Wiki editors have removed most of the smaller prizes offered to Sharmila because they didn’t like the Indian sounding names of the awards but they were fully referenced. Similarly they have removed at least one puppet production and two dance theatre productions about her. The graffiti image of her from Mumbhai is iconic. But because it wasn’t done by Banksy the snobbery of western wiki editors had it expunged. These people never use their real names and are bringing the concept of a free and open knowledge database into disrepute by the bullying and intimidation of anyone who disagrees with their nasty tactics in the case of this article. \\nUnless other wiki editors stand up to these petty racists who know nothing about India Manipur or Irom Sharmila yet pontificate on what can be posted here and now claim absolute power to remove any other editor who disagrees with them wiki is already dead. Hundreds will come to the article to learn more about Sharmila having read something somewhere and all will now leave disappointed because it adds nothing. The prime wiki editor of a people’s encylopaedia is people. The downside of giving the unqualified this sort of power is you reduce the quality and content of articles when ignorant bigot gangs take up personal vendettas. I presume the hope was you would only edit articles you where you had some knowledge of the subject. But some feel that they have now become professionalized wiki editors although they don’t need any outside reference to qualify them as experts.\\nBut back to the last key event that wiki will not allow to be noted along with many others. Usually before an interview the press are cautioned not to report any criticism of the Government of Manipur otherwise the privilege given to them will be removed. There’s an unspoken threat also that scribes have low life expectancy in Manipur. Manipur is like Sri Lanka only ',\n",

       "       '\"\\n\\n== Betacommand is back ==\\n\\nHello. I am contacting you because you are one of the editors/admins who is still active now, and was aware of the notoriously disruptive editor User:Betacommand, a.k.a User:Δ (Delta). As you probably know, he was eventually banned after a third arbitration case, due to the way he conducted himself in the pursuit of his main interest on Wikipedia, WP:NFCC enforcement.\\n\\nWhat you may not know, is that he has evidently returned and has been editing as User:Werieth since 2012, in violation of that ban. After just a year, Werieth is already causing the same sort of disruption that Betacommand did - you may experience some deja vu by reading reports made about Werieth such as the one at the top of this AN archive. There are already several others. A quick perusal of Werieth\\'s contributions will also reveal the same Betacommand-like self-assured approach, grounded in the belief that their edits are always \"\"100% correct and 100% according to policy\"\" (when the reality was that he made basic errors and pushed policy boundaries at a rate that, while acceptable in ordinary users for a time limited period, was found to be unacceptable in an editor with the edit rate and communication issues Betacommand had, especially given their inability to change)\\n\\nI and others have already tried to expose his return via these sock puppet investigations, although as you can see, it\\'s not getting far. That\\'s not for the lack of an answerable case though - you can see the latest summary in this post. Most of the obstruction can be put down to the usual dysfunctional and counter-productive aspects of Wikipedia governance, which of course will always aid experienced WP:GAMErs like Betacommand.\\n\\nBut you may or may not be surprised to learn that the people obstructing this investigation the hardest are three admins whose own conflict of interest with regard to Betacommand/NFCC is best demonstrated in their own words - Black Kite (repeatedly deflects attention away from Werieth and onto accusers), Kww (blocks accusers, and has already unblocked Werieth once) and Future Perfect at Sunrise (has basically declared all out war on anyone who even whispers that Werieth might be Betacommand).\\n\\nThe purpose of this post is to raise awareness about his return, and hopefully persuade one or more of you to resubmit that SPI with the evidence I\\'m sure you will be able to compile using your own knowledge of Betacommand\\'s characteristic traits. At the very least to prompt you to put his talk page on your watch lists and regularly review his contributions (although obviously, don\\'t waste your time trying to deal with any issues you see on the flawed basis that he is just any old user).\\n\\nAlso obviously, you should also raise a red flag every time you see one of those three admins trying to further suppress the inevitable exposure of his ban evasion. If his return is to be covered up for an unnecessarily long time, it should at least be done simply through general incompetence, rather than obvious COI based abuse of the tools/trusted position of admin. A few emails to the arbcom members who dealt with Betacommand also probably wouldn\\'t go amiss - if ordinary admins aren\\'t bothered about this particular user\\'s return (and you will remember, blinded by their enthusiasm for having someone, anyone, perform NFCC enforcement edits, a great many of them were unwilling to even admit his particular approach to that necessary work was a problem), \\n\\nBetacommand\\'s clandestine return to Wikipedia is bad enough as it is given that he has simply resumed where he left off in the NFCC enforcement field, with several users already having wasted a lot of time having to deal with him as if he were a legitimate user. But obviously the nightmare scenario if the cover-up is allowed to continue for another year, is if Werieth/Betacommand decides script assisted batch editing is not fast enough for his liking, and decides to take an altogether faster approach - possibly even trying to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff;=prev&oldid;=43661105',\n",
       "       '\"\\nThis block is even more outrageous and illegitimate than the first. You didn\\'t even allow me to say anything; that alone makes this charade illegitimate and unacceptable. The whole essence of Dougweller\\'s argument over the last few weeks has been that article talk pages can and should be viewed in isolation when addressing a dispute. Bbb23 and JamesBWatson agreed with him in this regard and that was the main basis for punishing me for the recent conflict that was started by Mzilikazi1939. Therefore my actions of yesterday constitute complete compliance with the rules and the comments from these two administrators. As was made crystal clear on Talk:Aesop yesterday, Mzilikazi and his friends never complied with the rules set out in WP:ERA in their latest attempt to change the article Aesop. I already tried merely correcting their illegal actions and explaining it in edit summaries and personal talk pages but they continued ramming through their illegal changes, so yesterday, even though corrections of rule breaches should not require discussion, I made the peace-making effort of explaining the matter on the talk page Talk:Aesop.\\n\\nI went above and beyond what was required in order to see a peaceful resolution to Mzilikazi\\'s edit war and I fully complied with both the Wikipedia rules and the wishes of the two administrators who had judged on the issue. If I broke the rules by obeying those administrators then the first block was obviously not valid and therefore an indefinite block now is not allowed. In fact, any punishment now would not be allowed because the alleged rule breach was entirely due to the directions given by Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, i.e. that article talk pages, as asserted by Dougweller, are meant to be viewed in isolation from other talk pages. My peace-making efforts yesterday were most certainly not a \"\"diatribe\"\"; it was a clearly and thoughtfully written explanation of what the issue was, how Mzilikazi\\'s actions breached the rules and even how to resolve the matter. Unlike what we\\'ve seen from Mzilikazi and Dougweller consistently, I included no personal attacks in my efforts of yesterday. Bb23 made the dubious accusation that I had used personal attacks in recent weeks but I reject that entirely; I never called anyone names and I never tried to rely on ad hominem arguments to \"\"justify\"\" my position, unlike what we\\'ve seen from Mzilikazi in particular. Yesterday\\'s edit was completely free from personal attacks; that\\'s undisputable.\\n\\nThe very fact that Bbb23 would describe yesterday\\'s tactful, eloquent, peace-making effort as \"\"diatribe\"\", an extremely strong word, is more than enough proof that he has strong feelings about the issue and, as per WP:INVOLVED is therefore ineligible to participate in an administrative capacity here. This is a breach of the same policy that  broke when he banned me years ago, causing him to be stripped of his administrator status. I was already wondering how Bbb23 could block me the first time with that non-sensical, contradictory excuse for an explanation.\\n\\nIf article talk pages aren\\'t meant to be viewed in isolation then both Aesop\\'s Fables and Aesop are meant to be using the standard English style of dates. That is what I originally insisted but for that I was blocked by Bbb23. However, if, as asserted by Dougweller and agreed to in the rulings of Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, article talk pages are meant to be viewed in isolation then Aesop\\'s Fables is a lost cause and Mzilikazi has got away with his change there but Aesop is still meant to remain in the BC/AD state.

       "       \"Here's an article that says morgellons is real. I'm gonna post it here and in the main article. I don't get why it's not there. Seems like Wikipedia really effed the heck up!\\n\\nClinical, cosmetic and investigational dermatology  CCID\\nDove Press\\nMorgellons disease: Analysis of a population with clinically confirmed microscopic subcutaneous fibers of unknown etiology\\nVirginia R Savely and Raphael B Stricker\\n\\nAdditional article information\\n\\nAbstract\\nBackground:\\nMorgellons disease is a controversial illness in which patients complain of stinging, burning, and biting sensations under the skin. Unusual subcutaneous fibers are the unique objective finding. The etiology of Morgellons disease is unknown, and diagnostic criteria have yet to be established. Our goal was to identify prevalent symptoms in patients with clinically confirmed subcutaneous fibers in order to develop a case definition for Morgellons disease.\\n\\nMethods:\\nPatients with subcutaneous fibers observed on physical examination (designated as the fiber group) were evaluated using a data extraction tool that measured clinical and demographic characteristics. The prevalence of symptoms common to the fiber group was then compared with the prevalence of these symptoms in patients with Lyme disease and no complaints of skin fibers.\\n\\nResults:\\nThe fiber group consisted of 122 patients. Significant findings in this group were an association with tick-borne diseases and hypothyroidism, high numbers from two states (Texas and California), high prevalence in middle-aged Caucasian women, and an increased prevalence of smoking and substance abuse. Although depression was noted in 29% of the fiber patients, pre-existing delusional disease was not reported. After adjusting for nonspecific symptoms, the most common symptoms reported in the fiber group were: crawling sensations under the skin; spontaneously appearing, slow-healing lesions; hyperpigmented scars when lesions heal; intense pruritus; seed-like objects, black specks, or “fuzz balls” in lesions or on intact skin; fine, thread-like fibers of varying colors in lesions and intact skin; lesions containing thick, tough, translucent fibers that are highly resistant to extraction; and a sensation of something trying to penetrate the skin from the inside out.\\n\\nConclusions:\\nThis study of the largest clinical cohort reported to date provides the basis for an accurate and clinically useful case definition for Morgellons disease.\\n\\nKeywords: Morgellons, subcutaneous fibers, pruritus, delusions of parasitosis, Lyme disease, skin lesions\\nIntroduction\\nMorgellons disease is a poorly understood multisystem illness characterized by stinging, biting, and crawling sensations under the skin.1 According to the Morgellons Research Foundation (MRF) website, more than 14,000 families are reportedly affected by this emerging disease.2 Considerable suffering occurs as thread-like fibers work their way out of the victim’s skin causing pain, itching, and open, disfiguring lesions (Figures 1 and \\u200band2).2). Unfortunately, patients are often dismissed as delusional by clinicians who are unfamiliar with the signs and symptoms of Morgellons disease.3–5 There is a scarcity of literature on Morgellons disease due to its relatively recent description in the modern medical literature, the reluctance on the part of the medical community to recognize it as anything other than psychopathology, and the lack of knowledge about its etiology and transmission.6\\n\\n\\t\\nFigure 1\\nMorgellons patient’s lower legs.

Reproduced with permission.\\nThe distinctive feature of Morgellons disease is the presence of microscopic subcutaneous fibers1 (Figures 3, \\u200b,4,4, and \\u200band5).5). Observation of the skin with a lighted, hand-held, 30 × to 60 × magnifier enables visualization of these red, blue, black, and white fibers that have the appearance of either straight hollow tubes or wiry tangled threads.1 At times the fibers are seen above the dermis as loosely clumped “fuzz balls” or as black specks the size of coffee grains. Examination of the black specks by electron microscopy reveals that they consist of a tightly woven ball of black fibers.6\\n\\n\\t\\nFigure 3\\nClose up of a leg lesion showing a twisted fiber just under the epidermis.

       "       '\"\\n\\n\\n==\"\"African descent\"\"?==\\nIf a model\\'s race must be stipulated (although I don\\'t see why it should be, since black plus-size models do very well in the industry, and are not particularly seen less often than Caucasian plus-size models), wouldn\\'t it be better to say that a model is \"\"black\"\" rather than \"\"of African descent\"\"? A good faith suggestion.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by    \\n\\n* It is relevant to denote her race in terms of the cosmetics work with Cover Girl; I strongly disagree that black models are \\'not particularly seen less often than caucasian models\\' in this style of model work or any other, especially in an international context.  Although they may do \\'as well\\' relatively, the amount of work is markedly less than that for caucasian models outside of the U.S.  Tesfay was born in Canada of Eritrean descent so the common descriptor \"\"African American\"\" is erroneous.  To make it simple, \\'black\\' it is.   \\n\\n==Link Spam==\\nNot sure where to look on Wiki for the answer to this, so I\\'ll ask here: when does a web link become web spam?  When the link breaks, or merely when someone notices that links have been added to an article?  For an article needing to find more sources, recent removals of all weblinks seems a bit overzealous to me.   \\n\\n==CALENDARS==\\nThe whole calendar paragraph is problematic now, I think; too big for the article relative to its significance. It\\'s not possible to rank these along with ANTM, print magazines, etc., any more than online magazines, because they don\\'t have anything like the same kind of public reach, and the naming of specific calendars in the first place invites spam. Since 2007, the year of the named calendars, is (nearly) over, and they haven\\'t become annual publications, I think the paragraph should be cut back to refer to the launch of several calendars in general, without naming specifics, otherwise there\\'s the impossible requirement of defining exactly what is or is not a notable calendar.  Also, the sentence about fostering a healthier industry attitude is too generic and applies to many projects involving plus-size models, not just these calendars. You\\'d need to repeat the same sentence in nearly every item in the article if it appears here. I recommend something like, \"\"2007 was the launch year for several grassroots calendar projects featuring women over a U.S. size 12, spurring similar projects in the following year.\"\"\\nPerhaps to be named, a calendar would have to merit its own Wiki entry, and undergo an AfD discussion.   \\n* I do not understand why you are trying to compare TV shows with consumer products and it is disingenuous of you to want to.  MODE no longer exists, should that be expunged from the article too?  I agree to a certain point about modifying the mention of calendars, however there are good media references available for the Fenomenal Calendar and this article sorely needs every good source link it can get.  The originators of a market niche are worth noting IMO; the rest are just jumping on the bandwagon (in terms of seeking self-promotion, not in production quality or financial returns) and certainly none of them yet are at the aesthetic level of Fenomenal, no matter what opinion one may hold on the theme of the styling, size of the models, or comparisons between unrelated other print products, such as MODE Magazine for example.  Further, I do not believe it necessary for a single mention to undergo AfD or else every model named to their own paragraph on this article should do the same.  I would think that a Fenomenal weblink is appropriate because the homepage remains visible online.  This calendar does set the standard for commercially-available calendar products; in the absence of Elena Miro\\'s calendar remaining online for people to see, which in any case was never available for purchase and should only be considered a promotional item - anything other in comparison is apples and turnips.\\n\\n* Suggestion: \"\"2007 was the launch year for several [link=http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/homegrown homegrown] calendar projects featuring women over a U.S. size 12, including the well-received (media reflink) Fenomenal Calendar (weblink).  These calendars have opened up a new market for the models to be seen outside of clothing advertising-only contexts, and also enabled them to capture the interest of people outside of the usual plus-size clothing consumer demographic.NEWL',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n==Spite==\\n, you accused me of \"\"spite\"\" on a public board for removing the article body content at Veniamin Sozin. (You accused of \"\"ownership\"\" as well, but I already explained at ANI how your interpretation of editsum was not correct.) Why I removed body content at Sozin is complex, but it wasn\\'t something as stupid and petty as \"\"spite\"\". It\\'s a big sorrow to me to have to leave ortho chess article editing. (I have loved it. I had no idea, the hostile and ruthless culture at WP, and the editors who revel in that environment to throw lies and smears and do bullying would ruin it for me. But I should have known better. The signs were early and my love of editing made me want to ignore them.) The deal is, Dennis, I regret ever creating that article (and there were only two others) for the orthochess project. I just regret it. And that regret, also somes with pain. And sorrow. But in the end, I wish I never edited for that subproject. I met some nice talented editors doing (e.g. ,  whom I learned to understand better and appreciate), but there were some bad apples, and the environment allowed them to make hay with me. That wasn\\'t nice. When defacto subproject leader Quale defamed me consistently by complimenting my detractors, and disparaging my good-faith efforts out of prejudice, well, that\\'s life in the big city, it\\'s political and nasty here, and I\\'m not willing to suck up to it. I\\'d rather leave. So I did. Seeing the three articles I left behind I created, that I can no longer expand, made me sick. I began to sincerely wish I never created them. So I made mercy killings of them. (Have you seen One Flew Over the Kookoo\\'s Nest? There\\'s a mercy killing in that movie. Was it spite!?) You apparently have no idea what complex emotion caused me to delete those contents, so, a quick & dirty answer you accuse on a public board, is that of \"\"spite\"\". (Why do you jump to suppose bad faith like that? You should think about that. In effect an accusation of \"\"spite\"\" is a dig of my character. I\\'ve never toilet-papered a house or lawntree in all my life. Or played a mean trick on anybody for fun. Why should I start now? To accuse me of mere spite is to say I\\'m no better than a juvenile delinquent. And you don\\'t see the insult value and personal affront in that? You are Mr. Editor Retention. And yet you seem clueless what I as editor have gone through, who has done a partial quit of Wikipedia  the quit of a subproject [orthochess]. The emotional toil is real and genuine. I know I cannot prove that, only attempt to explain to you. But please note how you jumped to bad faith explanation, and affront, and maybe why you would do that.Like I mentioned, the emotions were complex. Take one of the other three articles, for example: Paris Defence. Some of the above was at play with the deletion of that artice\\'s body content, but there was something else, too. I had to fight tooth-and-nail, to get that article to \\'Keep\\' status, and a WP:CHESS member also who is a deletionist kept pestering me about why the article couldn\\'t be \\'Merged\\'. The reasoning for \\'Delete\\' and \\'Merge\\' were all faulty, and I painstakingly and patiently tried to reason and explain. To little success. But the article stayed. Only through my perseverance, I guess. I never demanded the article stay  I don\\'t think I even !voted at the AfD for it. I simply made comments because even then, I had disassociated myself as project member due to already giving up on the level of civility from one editor initials CPL who you favored at your Talk against me, when I went to your Talk in good faith consel session, and there was no counsel discussion, just diaparaging criticisms of me, and I withdrew. That is when I never trusted you again. (Your compatriot Elen of Roads of course came in to render supportive disparaging criticisms of me, there and on her Talk, without end. You see how \"\"friendship\"\" explains all on the Wikipedia. Arguments are for losers, it seems.) The reason I deleted body content of Paris Defence is because I worked so hard, so very very hard, for the good, and consistency, of WP chess articles then, to keep it, and prove it. (CPL was saying the opening didn\\'t even exist. That it was a joke of a 3rd move by Black. Yet he was willing to tell everyone at any opportunity that he\\'s a \"\"chess Expert\"\" rating, in repeated boasting. I worked so very hard hard hard to keep that article, I improved it during the AfD, and it was amazing to me, because those imporovements didn\\'t seem to matter (no one said they did), when they were in fact central and vital and the whole point. So where does the sorrow come in? After working so hard as I did, for the reasons I did, I was alone. Alone alone alone. No support from the \"\"community\"\" of \"\"collaborative editors\"\"  what a Project is supposed to be all about. Silence. When my arguments to keep were valid, the',\n",

And I have an interest in seeing IP editors treated well, by the majority of us, not the few.\\n\\nThe recent visiting IP editor was so set upon by more experienced editors that I thought I would perform a first-pass (rough draft) evaluation of this article, strictly from the perspective of evaluating its sources.\\n\\nThe goals in doing this are three:\\n*(1) To allow us to come to consensus as to the quality of the article, at least in terms of verifiable information (though for this scientist, and for purists such as myself and NeilN, it is likely that if sources should come out, content must also);\\n*(2) To identify patterns of problems, so particular individuals with time and desire might address them (e.g., incomplete therefore unverifiable entries, poor specific sources for particular blocks of information, varyingly formatted similar sources and repeat sources making source followup difficult, etc.), and \\n*(3) To create a list of first issues to address, so that there might be a common set of priorities (i.e., where the list below might, in months to come, be sprinkled with  markers).\\n\\nIn doing this, I am applying the same academic standards as I might have in reviewing a paper submission from a sixth form or older student, on into university. This is the sort of thing that, while scholarly (so we might each might differ on the details of the analysis), all might agree to the trends represented (and all might have arrived at the same perception within minutes reviewing the article references, and have accomplished a full first-pass evaluation in an hour or so.) That is, we can see for ourselves, instead of taking the a priori position that all is fine enough to remain, or insisting a new editor argue her or his case, thoroughly and decisively, to more seasoned Wikipedia hands.\\n\\nAfter having done this evaluation, I have come to the conclusion that the article weaknesses referred to by the IP editor appear to be substantiated. From the persecutive of reliability of information, based on expectation of high quality and verifiable secondary sources suited to the content, I conclude that the article is in very poor condition.\\n\\nAfter reviewing this summary of the state of this article\\'s sources, see if you might not agree.\\n\\n\\nHere, in bullet form, are cogent observations from the evaluation of the article\\'s sourcing:\\n\\n* >70 references to 12 or more undergraduate textbooks as sources, rather than the scholarly secondary or tertiary sources drawn upon by those texts (see more below);\\n\\n* >70 references to books that appear without page numbers—King 2008 and King 2009 (47 refs), Buss, Crain (5), Boccadoro (2), Fausto-Sterling, Rathus (3), Russon, Farrell, Coon (2), Escoffier, Al-islam.org, Stearns Major Patterns, Stearns Sexuality (6), Greene;\\n\\n* 47 (36 plus 11) references to the same undergraduate textbook (King, 2008 and 2009), in two entries, all appearing without page numbers;\\n\\n* More than a half dozen books lacking full citations, particularly, date of publication (e.g., King, Buss, Stearns Major Patterns, Stearns Sexuality), but also, other obscured details (e.g., David Weeks, Secrets of the Superyoung.

       "       \"Honestly the way wiki is treating this is a JOKE\\n\\na. I could have cited NEWS SITES but since when is a news site worthy of an academic cite?\\n\\nb. if the person that wanted PEER REVIEW felt like it, he would have sought it 20 years ago, HE CHOSE NOT TO DO IT, but none the less his work is known and was mentioned in many math related 'forums' and most ignored it. \\n\\nc. Only the recent 2012 open source test of the work PROVED the 30Mod algorithm is a major thing in math, again, GITHUB is a programmers resource and it was not until a computer used the actual 30Mod algorithm that it was shown to be a 'big thing' and since then some news sites have covered it, but I chose not to cite them due to IMO they are not NPOV. But none the less they covered the story.\\n\\nd. The FACT is a major computer site where programmers have free reign to challenge any claims exists and for over two years not one programmer challenged the findings.\\n\\ne. so what if the person that discovered it works outside of academia and has no regard for normal 'peer review' the fact is he has no peers if you ask some in academia that know of his work, and I am one of those people that know of the work and how brilliant the work is.\\n\\nNow to summarize, we have a bunch of pags about primes on wiki, and even pages created after his discovery that USE his discovery (ie. the sieve of Atkin 60Mod work is his work discussed in the public forum and usenet math and physics forums is where he chose to discuss his amazing work.\\n\\nSo now you have 2004 sieve of Atkin using a 60Mod algorithm, guess what that was in his 1995 paper. So does wiki acknowledge that? No. And i didn't even bother to waste my time of the 60 mod algorithm since the big deal as you are saying is the PyPrimes test and I cited that very well, it's a program created in Python, I cited the wiki python page, then I cited Github for both PyPrimes and the PyPrimes testing.\\n\\nNow while MATH is m forte, I am sufficient enough in computer skills to understand what Github is and to understand how to read the speed tests and the prime spirals smoked every algorithm there is. Now anyone can download python (which I have done) and download pyprimes (which I have done) and run the tests. Guess what just like a math experiment, it is duplicated.\\n\\nSo GITHUB and the tests which are not 'new' should be enough to begin a wiki page on this truly amazing discovery in math.\\n\\nI myself became aware of the first paper in 1995, as did others in aademia. Recently I became aware of 'news sites' running stories citing what I copied, the links to the Github tests.\\n\\nWhile some here can say well it's not AMA, so what, in the world of primality testing primes spirals as per the PyPrimes results shows PRIME SPIRALS are a big deal.\\n\\nNow I tried to be NPOV in giving all sides of the story, Adoni has a valid 1995 claim I can verify it and I chose not to. But I cited a Drexel Math forum and I could have cited many other math sites discussing his 30mod, 60mod and 90mod prime work in the 1990's. Is this signficant? You bet it is since 60Mod prime sieve aka Atkin sieve is 20004 so his 60mod prime work is well before it.\\n\\nNow the Github tests mentions 'croft spirals', that's due to in 2010 a person named croft registering a web site and ripping off the 1995 work. MY OPINION.\\n\\nNow Croft can say all he wants that he found it playng his guitar or whatever he is claiming.\\n\\nThe fact is anyone can document Adoni with Prime theory from the 1990's saying 30mod, 60mod and 90mod is the key.\\n\\n9 Years later sieve of atkin appears, well that's only a rehash of the adoni 60mod work from the 1990's. Yet no one is giving him credit.\\n\\n2010 croft puts out his 30Mod work and its inserted into PyPrimes on Github and it smokes every major prime algorithm there is and all of them have pages on wiki as I cited.\\n\\nSo 2012 a work on Github verifies how important to primality the 30mod spirals are, but he says croft spirals, well guess what HelixQ is now out there and taking 100% credit for the 1995 work of Dr. Adoni.\\n\\nMy site to a Drexel math site from the 1990's mentioning 30Mod prime work (prime spirals) is a major cite, since Adoni could care less about the AMA or whatever, in all probability he will soon be nominated for a Nobel on his work, that is how important it is. \\n\\nThink about it, not one prime algorithm could beat the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, none of them. On a computer creating primes all other algorithms are terribly slow. The only two fast generators from scratch are the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes and the PRIME SPIRALS, and the winner was Prime Spirals. Now I can cite recent news articles about it, laughing at academics it links to that said it was no big deal in the 1990's who now all look foolish due \",\n",

Don\\'t distract yourself from the collective efforts to bring this discussion back on track.   \\n\\n==Restoring WP:NPOV to the Paris article==\\n\\nI invite everyone to read again the WP:NPOV policy of Wikipedia:\\nEditing from a neutral point of view (NPOV) means representing fairly, proportionately, and, as far as possible, without bias, all of the significant views that have been published by reliable sources on a topic. All Wikipedia articles and other encyclopedic content must be written from a neutral point of view. NPOV is a fundamental principle of Wikipedia and of other Wikimedia projects. This policy is nonnegotiable and all editors and articles must follow it.\\n\\nCurrently, the article is heavily biased towards a historical/heritage representation of Paris. The article is structured the same way as the article of Pompeii with most of its contents dedicated to describe past History, heritage sites, tourism, and past culture. The difference with Pompeii though is Paris hasn\\'t been destroyed by a volcano 2,000 years ago, and here goes the WP:POV.\\n\\nFacts about what is Paris today are marginalized in shrinked sections burried at the bottom. For the good of the debate, here are some facts about today\\'s Paris we should all remember. Economically speaking, Paris is among the top 5 cities generating the most wealth in the world, it hosts more headquarters of Fortune Global 500 firms than London or New York. Demographically speaking, it is a megapolis of 12 million people inhabitated by large communities coming from all countries in the world. Regarding infrastructures, it is one of the most important transport node in Europe, with 4 airports, 6 major railway stations linked to 4 different high-speed rail lines, and hosts the second largest river port in Europe.\\n\\nTo know whether or not the economics, demographics and infrastructures aspects of Paris are represented fairly, proportionately in the current article, I invite everyone to compare the size of the said sections with the one of those dedicated to History, heritage and culture (which in the case of Paris ignores its modern aspects as everyone obviously agreed here ). I\\'ve counted words of each section (including their paragraphs in introduction), and in order to give a point of comparison, I\\'ve done the same about London, which is a similar size capital city of a similar country.\\n{| class=\"\"wikitable\"\" style=\"\"text-align: center;\"\"\\n|rowspan=2 bgcolor=\"\"#EFEFEF\"\"|Field of interest\\n|colspan=2 bgcolor=\"\"#EFEFEF\"\"|Paris\\n|colspan=2 bgcolor=\"\"#EFEFEF\"\"|London\\n|- bgcolor=\"\"#EFEFEF\"\"\\n|Number of words||% of total||Number of words||% of total\\n|- \\n|align=\"\"left\"\"|History||align=\"\"right\"\"|3,573 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|22%||align=\"\"right\"\"|2,048 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|17%\\n|-\\n|align=\"\"left\"\"|Heritage||align=\"\"right\"\"|4,277 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|26%||align=\"\"right\"\"|204 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|2%\\n|-\\n|align=\"\"left\"\"|Culture||align=\"\"right\"\"|2,545 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|15%||align=\"\"right\"\"|1,661 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|14%\\n|- bgcolor=\"\"#B9CFDB\"\"\\n|align=\"\"left\"\"|Subtotal||align=\"\"right\"\"|10,395 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|63%||align=\"\"right\"\"|3,913 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|32%\\n|-\\n|align=\"\"left\"\"|Economy||align=\"\"right\"\"|673 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|4%||align=\"\"right\"\"|727 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|6%\\n|-\\n|align=\"\"left\"\"|Demographics||align=\"\"right\"\"|852 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|5%||align=\"\"right\"\"|1,605 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|13%\\n|-\\n|align=\"\"left\"\"|Transport||align=\"\"right\"\"|819 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|5%||align=\"\"right\"\"|1,693 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|14%\\n|- bgcolor=\"\"#B9CFDB\"\"\\n|align=\"\"left\"\"|Subtotal||align=\"\"right\"\"|2,344 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|13%||align=\"\"right\"\"|4,025 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|33%\\n|- bgcolor=\"\"#BDBBD7\"\"\\n|align=\"\"left\"\"|Overall total||align=\"\"right\"\"|16,388 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|100%||align=\"\"right\"\"|12,131 words||align=\"\"right\"\"|100%\\n|}\\nIt\\'s worth being mentionned though that London\\'s culture section is entirely dedicated to today\\'s culture. But even putting that aspect aside, the London article, which seems well-balanced, talk about as much of History, heritage and culture than it does of economy, demographics and transports. In the case of Paris, sections about the \"\"past\"\" aspects are 4.5 times bigger than those about today\\'s aspect. In reading this article, we can decently believe that today\\'s Paris is judged not relevant any',\n",

Eventually both might be merged into a streamlined example such as one completed about Dutch Elm disease. I think you would agree one of the most prevalent items making up today event is the unbelievable amount of misinformation continually supplied to the public Consciousness about this subject, including unproven theory from the best of tree Experts. So my goal is to utilize scientific peer review and field studies, along with other proven facts to correctly educate. Including successes and failures along with details about control through treatment also. Or are we supposed to produce a unique wiki page covering facts of how scientists properly apply insecticides. Yes even some facts seperatly belong within their specific wiki pages, like possible extinction of American Fraxinus placed on Fraxinus page. Or each page for 43 individual arthropods co-extinction caused by loss of ash. Separate \"\"Infestation\"\" page would have been central location where temporally collected items regarding main subject could be kept. Lets work together, thanks.   \\n:Hi . First off, please remember to put new sections on a talk page at the bottom (this is done automatically by using New section). That and other things are outlined at WP:TPG and help make sure things stay ordered. For content on the EAB page, there\\'s a bit behind all those edits I made awhile back, so stick with me:\\n\\n:I realize a lot of stuff I condensed was your previous work, but right now everything seems to fit together well. The merging was mainly based on parsing things down, but also how we deal with scientific content at Wikipedia. It\\'s definitely the ideal for Wikipedia articles in general that we summarize what the scientific consensus is on topics such as this. If you haven\\'t already, I highly suggest reading WP:SCIRS, which gives a good outline on what we should be trying to do with scientific content. Essentially, we\\'re striving to summarize what other reliable sources say for an encyclopedia. That means pulling from review articles since they do that for us. However, part of that is because we don\\'t generally regard primary sources (i.e. research articles) as reliable because those are communications within the scientific community. That\\'s because those articles are intended for other researchers to evaluate, and the general public (e.g. Wikipedia editors) are not qualified to assess whether the study was valid. For us as Wikipedia editors, we cannot assign what we call due WP:WEIGHT to an idea or specific study until it\\'s put in context through other researchers commenting on it or giving it validity (e.g. review articles). Now an introduction section can count as a mini-review article, but we generally don\\'t need that in this topic since we have a few review articles to pull from. \\n\\n:With all that said, it is not our goal to describe what the primary research is. That\\'s why I cut down a lot of the content as it was reading more like a journal than an encyclopedia (see WP:NOTJOURNAL). It\\'s very different writing content for say an academic paper than it is for a Wikipedia article. From what I\\'ve gathered about your edits, you\\'re very interested in generating very detailed information, which is perfectly normal for someone just getting their feet wet on scientific content here. However, the general goal of an encyclopedia is to have summarized information with references that lead to the more detailed information. A lot of the edits you\\'re probably interested in including still largely fall under that question of due weight such as whether we even include the content or how much detail does it get. It\\'s a learned skill, so I\\'m happy to explain things further at the EAB page is it\\'s directly related or here if it\\'s more general (i.e. Wikipedia\\'s policies and guidelines) if you have questions or something isn\\'t clear.   \"',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n== Disparity between Traditional Jewish Dates and Academic Dates ==\\n\\n, I will desist from making edits in this current article, since I feel my input might be misconstrued or disruptive, and that, of course, would not be my intent. However, please be apprised that there is a vast disparity between the traditional Jewish method of calibrating years based on a carefully guarded oral tradition, as opposed to modern methods used primarily by Christians who rely heavily upon the modern academic methods applied in dating chronology. The two are still reconcilable, but it will take a vast amount of effort and a person of \"\"long wind\"\" (patience) and extreme diligence to even begin to explain where the discrepancies have \"\"crept-in\"\" to ancient chronologies. The Jews insist that there were only 210 years of slavery in Egypt, although the 430 years mentioned in the Hebrew Bible are merely counted from the time of Isaac\\'s birth, until the departure of Israel from Egypt. You see, \"\"strangers in a land not theirs,\"\" really begins with Abraham\\'s seed in the land of Canaan. Anyway, my view is not to interrupt your work, but to let it proceed on course. I would, however, have preferred to see you mention more about the \"\"other method\"\" practiced by mainstream Judaism, whether it is accepted or not by Christian or academic circles. This would have given more balance to the current article. I have an inkling that someone will eventually start another article dealing only the Jewish tradition of biblical chronology.\\n\\nIf I might say, for us, the Scroll of Antiochus is considered a reliable source.\\n\\n CERTAIN FLAWS WITH MODERN SCHOLARSHIP:\\n \\nI wish to point out something about modern scholarship that I think we should be aware of. Research has been carried out in France by a certain Christian Robin and André Lemaire on the subject of the \\nQueen of Sheba and King Solomon.\\n \\nAndré Lemaire wrote: “The hypothesis of a Sheba in Northern Arabia at the beginning of the 1st millennium BCE (Noth 1968: 223-224; Würthwein 1977: 121; Eph‘al 21984: 88-89, 227-229; Garbini 1984; Sarkiö 1994:190; Mulder 1998: 509-510) has no basis and is generally abandoned (Robin 1992: col. 1109-1110, 1118; Avanzini 1996: 13; Kitchen 1997b: 128.”\\n \\nHe also writes: “The first mention of Sheba in Neo-Assyrian texts is to be dated mid-8th c. BCE with the story of a caravan of 200 camels coming from Tayma and Sheba to Hindanu (Middle-Euphrates) (Cavigneaux – Ismaïl 1990: 339-357; Frame 1995: 300; Younger 2003: 279-282; Holladay 2006: 319-321).”\\n \\nContrary to modern scholarship, it should be noted here that, in Jewish tradition, king Solomon did not begin his reign in circa 1,000 BCE, as purported by modern scholarship, but rather in circa 843 BCE, as we find in Jewish tradition. Likewise, in Jewish tradition, the first Temple was destroyed in 422 BCE, rather than in the erroneous date used by scholars of the western world to fix its destruction, i.e. in 586 BCE. Modern scholars totally ignore Jewish tradition and wrongly put historical events at least 200 years earlier, which accounts for the discrepancies in calibrating these important events and not finding historical records to substantiate these events.\\n \\nThe one major flaw in their critical view of Jewish texts is the belief that if they cannot find an archaeological document affirming a certain event mentioned in the Bible, for them it is as though the event never happened. This is a fallacy in logic.\\n\\nTo begin to tackle this tremendous difficulty with modern scholarship and Jewish tradition, we must first lay down a premise that will follow us all throughout this discussion, and that is the fact that historical records have been kept by Jews since ancient times, and they have often preserved these very written accounts of events by marking their dates in the Seleucid Era counting. This is vital, as without which information, it will be virtually impossible to determine the sequence of events and to correctly compare them with dates in the Julian / Gregorian calendars. \\n\\nThe Aramaic \"\"Scroll of Antiochus,\"\" known in Hebrew as \"\"Megillath Benei Hašmonai\"\" (The Scroll of the Sons of Asamoneus), is a curious document, alleged by Rabbi Saadia Gaon in his Introduction to \"\"Ha-Eggron\"\" to have been written by the elders of the schools of Hillel and Shammai in the Chaldaic language, meaning, a document that dates back earlier than the book Seder Olam, composed by Rabbi Yose b. Halpetha in the 2nd century CE. In that book, the \"\"Scroll of Antiochus,\"\" we find this remarkable remark, viz., that \"\"from the Second Temple\\'s rebuilding till the 23rd year of the reign of Antiochus Eupator, son of Antiochus Epiphanes, who invaded Judaea, there had transpired 213 years in total.\"\"\\n\\n בִּשׁנַת עַסרִין וּתלָת שְׁנִין לְמִמלְכֵיהּ, ב',\n",
       "       '\"\\n\\n== Politecnico di studi aziendali legal status ==\\n\\nThe Federal Administrative Court (TAF) decided that exist in Switzerland - national - basically two forms of recognition for colleges. This is, on the one hand, the recognition of a university as a person entitled to benefits under the Federal Law of 8 October 1999 on support for universities and cooperation in higher education (Law on Assistance to universities, LAU, RS 414.20), on the other accreditation in accordance with Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Federal Government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector (RS 414 205). Both the recognition according to the LAU is accreditation are awarded solely as a result of an examination of the quality (art. 11 cpv.3 letter. at LAU; Art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the Confederation and the University Cantons on support for universities and cooperation in higher education). The recognition according to the LAU is aimed at the provision of federal subsidies and is the responsibility of the Federal Council (Art. 12 para. 1 LAU), accreditation, by contrast, is conferred by the Conference Swiss University (art. 7 para. 1 of the Convention of 14 December 2000 between the federal government and University Cantons on cooperation in the university sector) and is a mark of quality, which does not confer on its holder the right to a federal financial aid (see. FF 1999 243, 355), (judgment of TAF of August 13, 2013 B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 10 et seq.). Accordingly, the mere exercise of a university is not subject to authorization and is based on the freedom of science and economic freedom, as stated in the preamble of the now decayed authorization of the State Council on 14 February 2006. ISSEA sa is then free to confer titles, without that this requires an estimate accreditation or recognition subsidies and must be considered as recognized by national law (judgment of the TAF of 13 August 2013, B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 11). The CRUS, is not responsible neither for accreditation or for recognition under the LAU and the list developed by this authority can be at most a working tool, not expounding this list legal effects (judgment of the TAF of August 13, 2013 B-5924/2012, consid. 2.1, p. 13Equni (talk)  Recognition and university accreditation in Switzerland: rulings clarifying The legal issues on the real value of the recognition and accreditation University in Switzerland have been resolved by some judgments of the Swiss Federal Courts. Recognition in the university system The Federal Court judgment with 5A-376/2008 of 7 May 2008 confirmed that the cantonal license to use the name \"\"university\"\" is a recognition of the status of universities in the Swiss university system, and say the opposite is true. That judgment has therefore \\'refuted the thesis of the Education Department of the Canton Ticino, in the person of Mr. Sandro Rusconi who mistakenly consider it a simple authorization to use the name University accreditation The Federal Court judgment with 2P.88 / 2006 of 20 January 2009 stated that the accreditation is not mandatory and that to pursue the occupation university in Switzerland do not need a state authorization, as well as the non-accreditation or fails such a procedure does not affect in any way the freedom to engage in teaching and research university. The Federal Court Ammnistrativo with judgment B-1567/2011 of February 8, 2012 has confirmed that the university accreditation is a simple quality mark Optional without any legal consequences. In other words it is a recognition of the validity of this or that title or this or that university from the state.

But passive aggression aside, I sincerely am a person who loves Person of Interest and Criminal Minds, as they have helped me deal with deep-seeded problems in my own life, as far-fetched as that may sound, so I make it my business to do the best I can to help keep fellow fans as informed as possible, and Wikipedia is an amazing vessel through which to do so. In my mind, I saw how many little error notices Wikipedia has put on the POI episode lists and wondered why my mistake was IMMEDIATELY centered out, but whoever made the mistakes of adding too long of an episode summary, over 40 times, was not reprimanded. However, it is foolish to assume they weren\\'t. I reacted much in disproportion to the situation, and I do not intend to do so again, as I want to respect Wikipedia\\'s rules. I just felt that a specific user had discredited my information for the sole purpose of undermining me. That did, in fact, happen on a page for Criminal Minds and I was the aggrieved party in that case. My information was solid, came straight from a co-executive producer, and yet this person continued reverting it, so I sought help and reported him. However, to think that same scenario applies to this POI conflict... I now see how slanted and nonsensical that is.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I will not add information unless it can be traced back to an original source, credible and solid. (like my addition of Fred Toye as director and Andy Callahan as co-writer of POI episode 5-10 - the 100th) I do apologize if I\\'ve offended you with my two aggressive edit summaries, as they were the result of misdirected anger and frustration. Thank you for informing me of where I went wrong, and remaining respectful and composed. I love to learn, and I\\'m glad I\\'ve learned more specific information about how to avoid reference/edit info-conflicts. I also want you to know that I\\'m well aware that Wikipedia is not a fan site. While I intend to show you the utmost respect, that was uncalled for. I can read - very well, in fact. Je peux parler en Français aussi, et je peux le comprendre. I know that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, that is why I try to be as thorough as possible, and if this sentence comes off as condescending, that is because you offended me as well. I did not insult you, or anyone specifically; what I did was make a childish, anger-driven, juvenile comparison of whoever reverted my edits to royalty, or self-appointed leaders. It was a mistake to do so, and since I\\'m not very good at conflict resolution - the fact that this is my best attempt to mend fences proves that - I\\'m going to stop now because I\\'m starting to argue with my own intentions. Please forgive my outburst, and be assured that it won\\'t happen again. I will continue to help build a stronger Season 5 episode table with solid references, but I fully intend to adhere to the rules and keep my opinions of other editors to myself.\\n\\nThank you for helping me to stay informed, so that I can continue to inform fellow TV Crime Drama fans. Happy editing and thank you for your kindness and composure in this matter.\\n\\nB. Edward \\nBef3481(2)   \"'],\n",
